				<h2>About the Book</h2>
				<p><i>Birdsong for the Curious Naturalist</i> is a basic, how-to guide that teaches anyone, from beginning to advanced bird-lover, how to listen to our singing planet. The approach is organized concept by concept, and nested within concepts, species by species.</p>
				<p>The book, together with this website, is a guide to field-listening, a guide to appreciating a singing bird, with examples for over 200 species throughout North America. Accompanying these species accounts are 734 recordings, more than 75 hours of bird sounds all available for download and further study, to be experienced at the most basic or the most advanced level, as desired by the individual listener. You can listen to a single red-winged blackbird song, for example, or relish the entire hour of an energized male singing through the dawn chorus.</p>
				<p>In addition, the 77 Explore sections guide the reader to simple yet profound listening experiences, each opportunity offering the listener the satisfaction of a journey of self-discovery. </p>
				<p><i>Birdsong for the Curious Naturalist</i> is your guide to listening, offering a life-changing immersion into the world of birdsong.
				To see what others are saying about the book, see The Reviews!</p>

				<h2>About the Author</h2>
				<p>Donald Kroodsma is a world-renowned authority on birdsong and professor emeritus of ornithology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. As a research scientist, he published widely on birdsong for more than 50 years, receiving life-time achievement awards from the American Ornithologists’ Union, the Wilson Ornithological Society, and the American Birding Association. More recently he has authored books that introduce the general public to birdsong: <i>The Singing Life of Birds</i> (winner of the John Burroughs Medal), <i>The Backyard Birdsong Guides</i>, <i>Birdsong by the Seasons</i>, and <i>Listening to a Continent Sing: Birdsong by Bicycle from the Atlantic to the Pacific</i>. He lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. For more information, see DonaldKroodsma.com.</p>

				<h2>Recording Birdsong</h2>
				
				<p class="lead">Soon you won't be content using the recordings that others supply for you, and you will want to make your own. With modern technology, that undertaking is increasingly simple, and increasingly inexpensive.</p> 
				<p>Rather than provide my own guidelines for recording, I refer you to the <a href=" https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/how-to/recording-techniques/ ">Macaulay Library</a>. There you will find all you need to know about “Audio recording techniques” and “Audio recording gear,” including up-to-date information on microphones, digital audio recorders, accessories, and smartphones. As of 2019, there are three superb videos by Greg Budney, ex-curator of the Library, telling how to record: The Basics, With Parabola, and With Shotgun Microphone.</p> 
				<p>  <a href="https://wilsonsociety.org/pubs/manual-of-field-and-laboratory-exercises-for-ornithology/">An exercise</a> prepared for the Wilson Ornithological Society also provides information on how to record with smartphones.</p>
				<p>My favorite recording system? I love parabolic microphones, because the highly directional parabolic reflector physically amplifies the sound from a distant source and concentrates it at the microphone, enabling much “cleaner” recordings of distant birds than a shotgun microphone can provide (but see advantages and disadvantages of various microphones on the Cornell website). I use a stereo <a href="http://www.telinga.com/">Telinga microphone</a> in the parabola, with good headphones over the ears (Sennheiser HD 25-1 II). For a recorder, I use a Sound Devices digital recorder (Model 722, an old one!), and my partner Janet Grenzke uses a Marantz PMD661. Our next recorder will probably be a MixPre from Sound Devices.</p>
				<p>When I want long recordings, perhaps even overnight, and when I can set the microphone fairly close to the bird, I use a Marantz PMD661 recorder and an Audio Technica BP4027 stereo shotgun microphone. An external Voltaic battery (Model V44) supplies the power for a session that might last overnight. Sample recordings with this setup include the night-singing mockingbirds (e.g., ♫238, ♫516) and the sage thrasher who sang predictably during the daytime from just a few perches (e.g., ♫518, ♫528).</p>
				<p>When I want to program a recorder to record only at certain times of the day over a week or more, all unattended, and when I will settle for a monaural recording, I use a <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/swift/">Swift</a>. Sample recordings include those from the night-singing sage thrasher (e.g., ♫519-527, ♫529-531), from the male northern cardinal singing at dawn (♫468-476), and from the female cardinal singing on the nest (♫60).</p>

				<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
				
				
				<p>1) Check out the exercise prepared for The Wilson Ornithological Society, on “Recording and analysis of bird vocalizations,” by Sylvia L. Halkin and Walter J. Berry, found <a href="https://wilsonsociety.org/pubs/manual-of-field-and-laboratory-exercises-for-ornithology/">here</a>. It offers good “how to” information: How to get the best recordings you can with a smartphone, extensive and helpful notes on how to use Raven Lite for analyzing sounds, etc. Included is a useful glossary of terms (e.g., vocalization, frequency, amplitude, etc.), and a list of questions you might be able to answer about bird sounds, much like my Explore sections.</p>
