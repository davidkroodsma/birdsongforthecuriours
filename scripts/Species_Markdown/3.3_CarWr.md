♫109. Eight male songs, just one example of each, excerpted from a
longer sequence in which each of the songs was repeated many times;
these eight songs represent perhaps a quarter of the songs he knows. A
commonly used mnemonic for the song is *tea-kettle tea-kettle
tea-kettle*, or *lib-er-ty, lib-er-ty, lib-er-ty*. October 16, 2003.

♫110. If the female Carolina wren were to learn her song and duet with
her mate, as do many of this wren's tropical relatives, the typical
*tea-kettle* song might be bisected, with one bird singing perhaps the
*tea*, the other the *kettle*, as I've simulated in this selection.
