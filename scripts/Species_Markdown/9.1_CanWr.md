♫641. Just below me in a collapsed lava tube, this male offered 37 songs
over about two hours; long silent intervals are deleted to simulate a
somewhat normal rate of singing. June 7, 2018. Lava Beds National
Monument, Tulelake, California. (7:39)

♫642. Rapid singing in response to an "intruding songster." Full
confession: I used playback of a canyon wren song to stimulate a
reluctant singer, only to get this tirade in response. Playbacks evoke
intense behavior, which may be normal under rare circumstances, but it's
not the behavior we typically witness in nature. For that reason, I
almost never use playbacks to stimulate birds to sing. All other
recordings in *Birdsong for the Curious Naturalist* have been made
without playback. May 27, 2009. Oxbow, Hell's Canyon, Oregon. (5:07)
