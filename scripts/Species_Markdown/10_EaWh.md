*He begins with the most modest of soft, pure-toned notes, ee ee eeeeeeeeee, then cracks the whip in one of the most distinctive,unmistakable songs heard in eastern Australia.*

♫725\_EasternWhipbird\_071105\_T970. Listen to all 11 minutes and youhear that this male has at least three different songs. Theintroductory notes of the first three songs are at about 2 kHz, thenext six much lower at about 1 kHz, the next 16 much higher, wellabove 4 kHz. He then drops back down to the 1 kHz song again, offeringthree songs there. After each of the last two songs, the femaleresponds with a strong pair of descending notes, *chew-chew*, afterwhich he stops singing. You might also have noticed that the nature ofthe whipcrack differs; the whipcrack in the first three songs glidesdown the scale, whereas the whipcrack in all others slides up.November 5, 2007.
