♫27. In early spring just after the ice has melted, I surprise a pair of
Canada geese on a lake in northern Michigan; initially, she can be heard
off to the left, he to the right, but she rapidly swims over to him
during these two minutes. His last full honk is at 1:06, after which he
only occasionally acknowledges her *hrink* with a barely audible *honk*.
Listen with headphones to hear the stereo effect. May 2, 2018. Atlanta,
