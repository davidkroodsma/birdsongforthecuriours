How Australian! Neither a fairy nor a wren, this bird is a mighty fine looker, and a fine singer as well. Its rapid, high-pitched songs are better appreciated at slower speeds (but you’re on your own there). They have a fascinating breeding biology: An adult pair, with the help of their offspring from previous nestings, raise the young in a given nest.

♫720. Complete with laughing kookaburra in the opening seconds. After some listening, and looking in Raven Lite, I wonder if any two songs from this male are alike. October 21, 2007. Lake Eachem, Queensland. (5:22)
