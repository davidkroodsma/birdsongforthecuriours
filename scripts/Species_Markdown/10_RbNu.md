His songs are a simple series of nasal *yank* notes, easily overlooked
in the morning chorus. Little is known about these songs, but some
attentive listening reveals that he varies both the speed of delivery
*and* the frequency of those *yank*s, suggesting that the simple story
for the closely related white-breasted nuthatch would be worth
revisiting (see Explore 2).

♫688. At 4:17 in this recording, this nuthatch noticeably slows the pace
of his *yank* notes, but if you listen carefully you will hear that he
also lowers the pitch. In this selection, he sings two different series
of *yank* songs, the first (let's call it A) for about the first four
minutes, then B for the last eight. When listening to a red-breasted
nuthatch, it is clear that you might have to listen for some minutes
before you hear him switch to a new version of his song. April 4, 2012.

♫689. In this selection, believed to be from the same male ten days
later, he lowers the pitch at the one minute mark, but the rate stays
pretty much the same. The first series of *yank* songs (call it C) is
different from those recorded ten days earlier (A), whereas the second
series is the same as B above. April 14, 2012. Rattlesnake Gutter, North
Leverett, Massachusetts. (8:51)

♫690. Listen here to just three songs, A, B, and C, back to back, and I
think you'll appreciate better the potential for variation in the *yank*
songs of this nuthatch. (0:19)
