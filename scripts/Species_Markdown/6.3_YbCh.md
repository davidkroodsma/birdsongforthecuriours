♫433. Listen for the *BOB* and *WHITE* notes, almost certainly mimicked
from the northern bobwhite, and mentally mark every time you hear those
two notes. At some point, you no longer hear those notes because the
chat has moved on to a new "package" of song phrases. Give yourself a
few minutes to listen--you are on "chat time"! If you're impatient,
listen to the last minute and confirm that the *BOB* and *WHITE* notes
are not there, and then go back and search for the transition between
song packages. June 3, 2010. Shawnee National Forest, Illinois. (10:28)

♫434. A night singer, on an otherwise silent stage. Hear any other birds
singing? Maybe another chat in the distance. Maybe a tree swallow in
song flight, anticipating the dawn? Pick a unique song and try to chart
this male's use of it during these 11 minutes. The first four songs seem
not to occur again, suggesting that at 0:18 he is switching to a new
package of songs. The series of three (sometimes four) buzzy notes at
0:36 no longer occurs after 2:50; the series of rising whistles, first
heard at 1:04, also ends about there, at 2:44, signaling the end of one
package and the beginning of the next. Listen for the "policeman's
whistle" (not an actual imitation, though, I'm sure) at 9:18. 4:00 to
4:11 a.m. Sunrise at 5:08 a.m. May 27, 2009.
Oxbow, Hells Canyon, Oregon. (10:59)
