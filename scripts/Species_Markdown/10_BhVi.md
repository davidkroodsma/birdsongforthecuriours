We have had the opportunity to compare several vireos, including the
white-eyed, Bell's, yellow-throated, Philadelphia, red-eyed, and
warbling. The white-eyed typically sings with eventual variety, offering
one song many times before switching to another. The Bell's and
yellow-throated, and probably the Philadelphia, sing in packages. The
red-eye tends to run through his entire repertoire before repeating
himself. The songs of the warbling vireo are long and complex, making it
difficult to hear any patterns.

Here's another vireo opportunity. How does the blue-headed vireo fit in
with other vireos? What can you hear? What can you see in Raven Lite?
How many different songs does he sing?

â™«705. Here is an early migrant in northern Michigan, and here is my vocal
summary at the end of the recording: "OK, Mr. Blue-headed vireo wins. He
keeps moving north on me, and I walk to keep up, and every once in a
while he goes into this little sputtering, singing routine. It's very
nice. I might have recorded three of them \[at 2:44, 6:58, 12:08\]. Many
times he was too distant, other times too close. It will be a mixed
medley of songs from that bird. The key thing was that I let the
recorder run so that I got a continuous recording of what he was doing
for about 13 minutes." Just how does he deliver his song repertoire?
