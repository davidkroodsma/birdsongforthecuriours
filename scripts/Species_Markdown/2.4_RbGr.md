♫62. She sings too, but from the nest. Hear her relatively weak song at
0:03, 0:16, and 0:56; she also calls, a sharp *chip*, five times between
0:29 and 0:56. With the male approaching (hear his songs becoming
louder), she eventually slips off the nest, and by 1:30 he begins his
lusty singing from the nest. He continues incubating and singing for
about eight minutes, and at 9:11 can be heard just off the nest to the
right. All this is best heard with stereo headphones, of course! May 16,
2017. Hadley, Massachusetts. (9:28)
