Before almost all other birds are stirring, while it's stillpitch-black out, the willie sings from a bush beside the road. He is,in fact, known to sing through the night. *Sweet, pretty creature* heis said to sing. Listen carefully and you may hear him play with twodifferent songs. When he sings a double song, are they always of thetwo different types? Does he favor one song over the other? In whatpattern does he sing?
