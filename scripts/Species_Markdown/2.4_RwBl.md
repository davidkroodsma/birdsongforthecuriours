♫55. Male songs, in the minutes before the female first appears on the
territory in the morning (recording continued in ♫56 below). Note a
second male singing in the background (e.g., 0:10, 0:22, 0:50, etc.);
hear also how the foreground male changes to a different song at 2:18.

♫56. A little after sunrise, the female has now joined her mate; she
calls in the foreground, initially responding with a loud
*chit-chit-chit-chit* call to each of the male's songs heard in the
background. She eventually utters her aggressive, descending
*teer-teer-teer-teer* call (at 0:51), probably a notice to other females
that they're not especially welcome here. May 4, 2017. Atlanta,
Michigan. (6:46)
