A reminder that our world is full of explorable sound, whether from bird, mammal, insect, or whatever. An iconic symbol of Tasmania, the devil is a carnivore, though it eats mostly carrion. Inside an enclosure at the world-class conservation facility at Cradle Mountain, Tasmania, we were warned that if a devil came too close, we were to hold a foot up, soles out, not toes out; the broad, flat bottom of the foot would give nothing that the devil could get its jaws around, as the strength of its jaws would make short work of the toe-first foot. Listen to the resident devils discuss who has priority at the evening meal, with a bit of bone crunching thrown in.
