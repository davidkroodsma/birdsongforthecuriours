A reminder that our world is full of explorable sound, whether frombird, mammal, insect, or whatever. An iconic symbol of Tasmania, thedevil is a carnivore, though it eats mostly carrion. Inside anenclosure at the world-class conservation facility at Cradle Mountain,Tasmania, we were warned that if a devil came too close, we were tohold a foot up, soles out, not toes out; the broad, flat bottom of thefoot would give nothing that the devil could get its jaws around, asthe strength of its jaws would make short work of the toe-first foot.Listen to the resident devils discuss who has priority at the eveningmeal, with a bit of bone crunching thrown in.
