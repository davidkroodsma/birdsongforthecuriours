The golden-crowned kinglet offers a nice comparison to the ruby-crowned kinglet, the only other member of
the family Regulidae in North America. Listen to this golden-crown greet
the dawn on the longest day of the year, June 21. You can test your
hearing simultaneously, given that much of the song is above 7 kHz.

â™«696. He begins at 4:29 a.m., with sunrise 34 minutes
later at 5:03 a.m. (Could I have missed some of his
earlier songs? Possibly, though I thought I was standing in the right
place waiting for him.). Curiously, as is often the case with
ruby-crowns, most songs are incomplete, with the first complete song in
this selection beginning at 0:52. Can you detect any pattern in his
delivery? A complete song every, say, fifth song? Or at random?

June 21, 2013. Iron River, Michigan. (5:03) Thank you, Beth Tiller, for
sharing your birds with me.
