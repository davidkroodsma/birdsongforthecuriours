In the family Cardinalidae, the blue grosbeak is a distant relative to
the superbly singing rose-breasted and black-headed grosbeaks in the
genus *Pheucticus*, but a close relative of the indigo, lazuli, and
painted buntings in the genus *Passerina*. What's your impression of
this bird? How does its singing compare to that of the buntings? Can you
detect any pattern in how this Texas male is singing?

â™«695. I set the microphone down by this male's singing tree and came
back hours later to discover that he had in fact obliged. At 19:20 the
recording fades out and then back in, denoting a silence from this bird
of about 50 minutes. Can you detect any pattern in how this Texas male
is singing? April 22, 2013. Kerr Wildlife Management Area, Hunt, Texas.
