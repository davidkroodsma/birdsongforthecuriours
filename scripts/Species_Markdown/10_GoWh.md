What's not to like about a bird named a "whistler," whether of the"golden" (this bird) or the "rufous" kind (next bird)? What I find sostriking in the songs of this bird, in addition to the stunning purityof the notes, is the similarity of these golden whistler songs to thewhipcrack songs of the whipbird. The whipbird above (♫726) had (atleast) three different whipcrack songs in his repertoire, and so doesthis whistler, distinguishable in part by the frequency of theintroductory *ee ee ee ee ee ee notes*.

Here are two 21-minute selections, in addition to the extractedwhipcrack songs, from the same individual.

♫727. Twenty-one minutes of fine listening. November 1, 2007.Goomburra Section of the Main Range National Park, Queensland. (21:12)

♫728. Nine songs extracted from the above, consisting of threerenditions of each of three different songs, all what I am callingwhipcrack songs, rather similar to those of the eastern whipbird.Compare these whipcrack songs to those of the actual whipbird in ♫726.Coincidence? Chance convergence? Mimicry? I don't know. (0:49)

♫729. More fine listening. Does he do anything new in these additional21 minutes? A rufous fantail (see below) commandeers the microphoneafter 18 minutes. (21:12)
