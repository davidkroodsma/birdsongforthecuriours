Colonial honeyeaters, bell miners live in large, complex socialgroups. The miners feed mostly on the casings of psyllid bugs, whichuse eucalyptus sap to create their protective covering overthemselves. A colony of miners defends its patch of the forest fromalmost all other small birds that might compete for their food source.As a result, this recording is relatively free of all other birdsounds.
