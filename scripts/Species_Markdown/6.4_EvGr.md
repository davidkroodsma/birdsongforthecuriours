â™«447. Two call notes are often heard from these grosbeaks: a loud,
piercing, down-slurred *cheer*, or *peeer*, and a quieter, raspy trill.
In this pre-breeding flock, in a tree above a feeder, several birds are
involved giving a variety of renditions of these two calls. In the
background you can hear two tufted titmice matching each other's songs
(especially audible from 1:14 to 1:34). April 4, 2012. Cricket Hill,
Conway, Massachusetts. (9:52)
