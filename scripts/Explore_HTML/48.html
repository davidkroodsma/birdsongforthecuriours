  <p><strong>Dawn-calling choruses in Swainson's thrushes and veeries.</strong> What is
  it about these thrushes, and no other species I know, that leads them
  to call like this rather than sing? Does the intensity and duration of
  calling vary with the season, from the time they arrive from
  migration, through pairing, nesting, and into late June and July? How
  many birds within a territory are calling? Initially just one bird,
  the male who has arrived first from migration, then two birds after
  pairing? Or how about after the babies have fledged? Does the entire
  family awake in a calling bout? Do they also call like this upon
  awaking in South America during the nonbreeding season? Or in
  migration? So many questions, so few answers.</p>
