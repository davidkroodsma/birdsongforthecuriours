<p><strong>The puzzling case of the California thrasher.</strong> It would befascinating to find where a California thrasher awakes, morning aftermorning, and listen to (and record) all that he can do. Would he everreturn to something he had sung before? If so, how many days oflistening would it take to hear some repetition? If never, does hecompose original songs each day, settling on some theme that mostsatisfies him, or has he a seemingly infinite store of set themes tochoose from? Thrashers---what extraordinary singers!</p>
