  <p><strong>Songs of ruby-crowned kinglets.</strong> Under what conditions do these
  kinglets sing complete songs? When do they stop with incomplete songs,
  and when do they add calls to their performance? Compare all this
  variety to the seemingly invariant song of the savannah sparrow, for
  example---see below. I'm also curious about those two-syllable and
  three-syllable endings, which are readily distinguished by ear. How
  are they distributed geographically? Are there small dialects of the
  two forms distributed throughout the range? I have read that western
  birds tend to have the two-syllable <em>tee-LETT</em> endings, eastern birds
  the three-syllable <em>tee-da-LETT</em>. Is this true? Someone needs to plot
  these two song forms on a map so that we have some clear answers.</p>
