<p><strong>Songs of ruby-crowned kinglets.</strong> Under what conditions do thesekinglets sing complete songs? When do they stop with incomplete songs,and when do they add calls to their performance? Compare all thisvariety to the seemingly invariant song of the savannah sparrow, forexample---see below. I'm also curious about those two-syllable andthree-syllable endings, which are readily distinguished by ear. Howare they distributed geographically? Are there small dialects of thetwo forms distributed throughout the range? I have read that westernbirds tend to have the two-syllable <em>tee-LETT</em> endings, eastern birdsthe three-syllable <em>tee-da-LETT</em>. Is this true? Someone needs to plotthese two song forms on a map so that we have some clear answers.</p>
