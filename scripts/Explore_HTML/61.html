<p><strong>Sage thrasher songs, through the night.</strong> How (and when, where, why) birds sing in the night puts us in largely uncharted territory. For three nights, from the evening of June 12 to the morning of June 15, 2018, in Sierra Valley, California, I placed a Swift recorder (see "Recording birdsong") near a male's night roost. He obliged with an outpouring of song, and for two mornings I followed him after he left his night roost, to enable a comparison of his "day" songs with his "night" songs (♫518-531).</p>

<p>You can use these recordings to explore so many questions that are currently unanswered: Exactly when in the night does he sing? Is it the same pattern night after night? How do night songs compare to day songs, in duration, complexity, or whatever other measure you can come up with? In just a quick sampling of songs from ♫523, just aftermidnight on June 14, I was astonished to see that this free-wheeling bird that I knew from the daytime, who sang what seemed an endless variety of songs, was <em>repeating himself</em>, with successive songs at times identical! Compare songs at 8:14 and 8:58, for example, or the two at 14:14 and 15:24, or the five-second songs at 24:06 and 24:44. I did not realize that a sage thrasher was capable of repeating himself like this.</p>

<p>I love listening for mimicry: soras, barn swallows, so many more. After marveling at the enormous variety of sounds, I pick one that I can readily distinguish from all the others, such as the two pure-toned notes that sound like the introductory notes of a vesper sparrow song; in ♫528, hear them at 1:36, 2:37, and 3:48. Then I try to find them again. Want to join me in the search? The search is faster if you scroll through the sonagrams in Raven Lite, without actually listening. Any luck finding where those particular notes recur? What have you learned about sage thrashers in the process?</p>

<p>Morning of June 12</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>♫518. Here is a good sample of dawn singing after the male leaves his night singing roost. In the distance, hear one song from this male's night perch (from 0:02 to 0:17); by 0:25 he is flying toward where the microphone will record him for the next 99 minutes! 4:50 to 6:29 a.m.; sunrise at 5:33 a.m. June 12, 2018. Sierra Valley, California. (1:38:37)</p>

Where was he between 2:19 a.m. and 4:50 a.m.? Still in his night perch and quiet? A great distance away (about one hundred yards or more) so that the microphone would not pick him up? My best guess is that he was in place and quiet&mdash;-but that seems so unlike what he did the previous two nights. (19:14)</p>

<p>Perhaps a confession is in order. The night singing was recorded by a
Swift recorder (monaural; see "Recording birdsong" for the recording
gear I use) placed near the bird's night roost. I was not there. On two
mornings I arrived about 4 a.m. to be ready for his singing once he
departed his night roost; those songs, when he was on the fence posts
beside the road, were recorded with a stereo shotgun microphone
(Audio-Technica BP4027). I wasn't there then either! I was off listening
to western meadowlarks, marsh wrens, yellow-headed blackbirds, and
whatever else was singing. The sage thrasher predictably sang from the
same perches, so he took care of recording himself.</p>
