<p><strong>Whistling wings of mourning doves.</strong> Mourning doves offer listeningopportunities everywhere across North America. Do they always whistlewith their wings when taking off and landing? How about when theyapproach or leave their nest, when you would expect them to be silent?Or maybe the wings whistle only when we spook them, or when they arespooked by something else? Are all takeoffs identical, with the sameduration of whistling? The official Birds of North America accountdeclares "Function [of wing whistling] unknown but may have somealarm-sounding value at takeoff." But, I then ask, what about thefunction at landing?</p>
