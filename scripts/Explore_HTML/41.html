<p><strong>Patience in listening to songs of a brown thrasher.</strong> You can do ityourself! Pick one of those ten distinctive songs (maybe the chickadeeimitation, given how easily it is recognized) and listen for thatparticular song in one of the thrasher recordings. Be patient! Realizethat the most frequent imitations (loon and chipping sparrow) occurredjust once every 18 minutes; the meadowlark song occurred only once inthe three and a quarter hours (see "return times" in the book text)!As you listen, count the number of doublets that you hear. Expand yourexperience by listening to another of the thrasher recordings, or bylistening for another of the ten species imitations in the samerecording. Play with your numbers and do the math, as discussed in thebook. Based on this brown thrasher experience, the possibilities arelimitless for what your unaided ears can teach you about otherspecies.</p>
