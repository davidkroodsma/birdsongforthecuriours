<p><strong>Choose your own dawn chorus experience.</strong> During the dawn chorus it
seems that every flycatcher and every songbird (and many nonpasserines
as well) expresses an unbridled passion that you can't hear at other
times of the day. For some good dawn listening on your own, you could
start with one of the examples I have offered above, but that is just a
beginning, as hundreds of other species await your attention. Among my
favorites are---well, my list of favorites has grown to include almost
every flycatcher and songbird I know: kingbirds, wood-pewees, phoebes,
crested flycatchers, the dozen species in the genus <em>Empidonax</em> (p. 151)
. . . That's just the flycatchers, and then there are all the songbirds!
Okay, there may be a few species who seem to do nothing special at dawn
(perhaps some of the songless songbirds, p. 104), but so few that they
are tough to find.</p>
