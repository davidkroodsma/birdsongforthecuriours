<p><strong>What do songless songbirds do during the dawn chorus?</strong> For thesesongbirds without a song, the dawn chorus (see "Energized DawnSinging," p. 112) is worth exploring more intently. That time of dayis most likely to tell us what a songless bird considers to be itssong, if it has one, or which of its sounds functions in the same waythat the songs of other songbirds do. When all other species aresinging intensely during the dawn chorus, just what are thesesupposedly songless songbirds doing? Good question, but one with noobvious answers from any ornithologists, it seems. Are these songlesssongbirds passionless during the dawn chorus, or do they express theirpassion in some way, perhaps with vocalizations that we consider to be"calls"?</p>
