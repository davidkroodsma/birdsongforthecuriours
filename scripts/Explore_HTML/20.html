<p><strong>Seeing the two voices of birds in sonagrams.</strong> Like so many otherexplorations, this one also requires a computer program to graph thesongs, such as Raven Lite (see book page 3).</p>

<p>In sonagrams, one can see that most birds utter different sounds inrapid succession, not simultaneously. One cannot know if these soundsare all produced by the same voice box or if the bird rapidlyalternates between the two sound sources. Only if two very differentsounds occur simultaneously, with one sound above the other in thesonagram, can one know for sure that both voice boxes are engaged.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the American robin. Download the recording of asinging robin (♫14) and <em>see</em> how he sings a string of his low carolsand then punctuates it with a high, screechy <em>eek</em>. Is he using onevoice box throughout, or two? Can\'t tell. Clues come from anotherrecording, in which a mid-winter robin seems to be practicing, singinghis low carols and high screechy <em>eek</em>s <em>simultaneously</em> (♫129). Youhave to see it to believe it, and then slowing the songs to quarterspeed helps some more; some of my favorite examples showing twosimultaneous voices are at 0:39, 0:49, and 0:57). As with othersongbirds, the low voices (carols) are no doubt from the left syrinx,the high voices (<em>eek</em>s) from the right. His practice reveals a true,two-voice virtuoso, like a wood thrush, but during normal singing hechooses, for whatever reason, to sing the carols and <em>eek</em>s insuccession (as in ♫14), rather than simultaneously. How sad, I think,as I like the practicing robin better!</p>

<p>♫129: The robin practicing on a winter morning (Christmas, in fact)reveals how the low carols are sung with one voice box (almostcertainly the left) and the higher <em>hisselly</em>s with the other voicebox (almost certainly the right). December 25, 2005. Amherst,Massachusetts. (1:29)</p>
