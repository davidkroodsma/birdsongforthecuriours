<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Themes and variations in birdsong.</strong> Instinctively, we use the
  "theme and variations" approach as we learn to use songs to identify
  species. All songs of a given species fall into a recognizable
  pattern, the theme. Name your species, and then describe how you
  distinguish the songs of that species from the songs of others. For
  some species, such as an American redstart, it might be difficult to
  verbalize what we hear, but we nevertheless do hear a constant
  "theme," some consistency in a pattern or tempo or quality that
  identifies the singing bird as a redstart. The variations can be
  endless, of course, and therein lies the challenge of identifying each
  singing individual to species!</p>
