<p><strong>Themes and variations in birdsong.</strong> Instinctively, we use the"theme and variations" approach as we learn to use songs to identifyspecies. All songs of a given species fall into a recognizablepattern, the theme. Name your species, and then describe how youdistinguish the songs of that species from the songs of others. Forsome species, such as an American redstart, it might be difficult toverbalize what we hear, but we nevertheless do hear a constant"theme," some consistency in a pattern or tempo or quality thatidentifies the singing bird as a redstart. The variations can beendless, of course, and therein lies the challenge of identifying eachsinging individual to species!</p>
