<p><strong>Just what is a "species"?</strong> Ornithologists face one dilemma after another when they try to answer the question "Do these birds represent one or two (or more) species?" We come to take field guides as gospel, but lurking behind so many of the species illustrated there are these kinds of species conundrums. Here is a short list of some field guide species for which ornithologists wonder whether they constitute two or more different species. As you travel, listen up! How do the sounds of these species vary geographically?</p>
