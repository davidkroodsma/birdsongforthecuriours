<p><strong>Bicycling among dickcissel song dialects.</strong> Enjoy bicycling? There is no finer place than in dickcissel country, the heartland of the United States, along quiet paved or gravel country roads. That's the best way to hear the dickcissel dialects as you move quickly from bird to bird, and from dialect to dialect. Get to know a fairly small area and plot the road-side dialects that you hear on a map. Better yet, record some of the songs, make sonagrams, and plot those on a map. Maybe return the following year to determine if the songs or their distribution have changed.</p>
