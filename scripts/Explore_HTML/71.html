  <p><strong>Song changes over evolutionary time.</strong> The above examples focus on
  just a few species, but throughout this book are many other examples
  of closely related species that could be compared. See "Who's Who" on
  p. 170, for example, and look for close relatives in the same genus.
  Here are a few additional comparisons that I find intriguing:</p>
  
  <p>Eastern whip-poor-will, Mexican whip-poor-will in the genus
  <em>Antrostomus</em> (p. 171)</p>
  
  <p>The sapsuckers in the genus <em>Sphyrapicus</em> (p. 173)</p>
  
  <p>Eastern phoebe, Say's phoebe, black phoebe in the genus <em>Sayornis</em> (p.
  174)</p>
  
  <p>Vireos in the genus <em>Vireo</em> (p. 174)</p>
  
  <p>Chickadees in the genus <em>Poecile</em> (p. 175)</p>
  
  <p>Sedge wren, marsh wren in the genus <em>Cistothorus</em> (p. 175)</p>
  
  <p>Thrushes in the genus <em>Catharus</em> (p. 176)</p>
  
  <p>Thrashers in the genus <em>Toxostoma</em> (p. 176)</p>
  
  <p>Sparrows in the genera <em>Spizella</em> and <em>Zonotrichia</em> (p. 177)</p>
  
  <p>Warblers in the genera <em>Geothlypis</em> and <em>Setophaga</em> (p. 178)</p>
  
  <p>Buntings in the genus <em>Passerina</em> (p. 178)</p>
