<p>♫586. Typical songs of the North American "species" of the sedge wren.
Hear the switch to a new song at 1:00? At 2:14? That's a new song tacked
onto the end as well (at 3:40), after the calling red-winged blackbirds
(hear the call matching among the blackbirds?). May 23, 2004. Sebree,
Kentucky. (3:43)</p>

<p>♫587. How different those songs are from the songs I head in Brazil!
What's more, the birds iin Brazil learn their songs and match each other
during countersinging exchanges, so different from how sedge wrens
behave in North America. In this recording, hear one male deliver a song
and then almost immediately his neighbor answers with the identical
song. Six consecutive matches can be heard, beginning at 0:03, 0:05,
0:08, 0:11, 0:14, and 0:16. January 18, 1994. Brasilia National Park,
Brasilia, Brazil. (0:24)</p>

<p>♫588. A brief sample of songs from Costa Rica, with a female calling
nearby. These male "sedge wrens" in Costa Rica also learn their songs.
July 20, 1997. Coris, Costa Rica. (0:29)</p>

<p>♫589. Resident Falkland Islands birds also imitate songs. In the
background is a "jackass penguin," not a donkey. Throughout the
Americas, it would seem that many different "species" of sedge wren can
be found. February 15, 1996. Kidney Island, Falkland Islands. (0:27)</p>
