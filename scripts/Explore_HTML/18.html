<p><strong>Bird brains and special song control neurons.</strong> Beginning on book page
170, look over the "Who's Who" list of birds. Drop down to the Order
Passeriformes. In the family Tyrannidae, which in North America are all
flycatchers, realize that there are no special song learning centers in
the brain, and songs of all flycatchers in this group are believed to be
innate. Next in the list are the shrikes (Laniidae), vireos
(Vireonidae), all the way through to the cardinals and their relatives
(Cardinalidae); these are all the true songbirds, the oscines, all of
which have the special brain centers. As you listen to birds, note the
relative complexity of their singing efforts, and try to appreciate
those differences in the context of the neural substrates for singing in
the brain.</p>
