<p><strong>Mallard <em>quack</em>s and <em>rab-rab</em>s.</strong> Mallard ducks occur nearly everywhere in North America. Find them on a pond in a suburban park and listen to the variety of sounds they make. Can you confirm that only females <em>QUACK</em>? Do only males <em>rab</em>? Try to follow an individual female and determine when or if or how she quacks, and under what circumstances. Or follow an individual male, listening for his <em>rab</em> notes.</p>
