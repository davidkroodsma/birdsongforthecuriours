<p><strong>Listening for practice singing during spring.</strong> Come spring, withmigrants returning, it can be difficult to distinguish the yearlingsfrom the older birds who are coming back into song. When first-yearsingers can be identified by their subadult plumage, such as withindigo buntings and American redstarts, one can be certain that theimperfect songs from those birds are a continuation of the songlearning process begun the previous year. For most species, however,one cannot be sure of the singer's age. At any rate, what fun tolisten as both young and old birds rehearse tunes for the comingbreeding season. Certain sparrows provide especially good listeningopportunities as they prepare to migrate north. In the Southeast arethe white-throated sparrows, in the far West the golden-crownedsparrows, and throughout much of the West and South the white-crowns.There is nothing quite like a flock of western Brewer's sparrows allin practice song (see p. 121), or a flock of spring dark-eyed juncos,an entire tree full of them in jingly practice song (imagine manyindividuals like the one in ♫186, in contrast to the stable adult songin ♫187).</p>
