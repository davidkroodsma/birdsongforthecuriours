<p><strong>Get to know the American woodcock.</strong> If you live in the East, find awoodcock during early spring. At dusk, perhaps you will hear him firstoverhead, flying over an area roughly the size of a football field.When he stops his overhead singing, wait 15 to 20 seconds until youhear where he has landed, now <em>peent</em>ing on the ground; next time heis airborne, walk closer to his ground arena, to identify the site,but stop well short of it, and stop moving before he returns! Maybethe next day, an hour before sunset (in good weather, of course,dressed warmly), sneak in to about 30 yards from this arena, andsettle into a comfortable spot, well hidden perhaps behind some bushesso as not to disturb him, and wait. He'll appear soon, maybe walkinginto his arena, perhaps flying in. How many times does he <em>peent</em>, andhow rapidly, over what time period, before his first flight? How muchtime and how many <em>peent</em>s before the next flight? Are his displayflights at all coordinated with the display flights of any <em>peent</em>ingneighbors? It'll all be over in an hour or so, so stay with him. Studyyour numbers and your notes and you will have come to know a whole newwoodcock. Then there's dawn! Does he behave any differently then?</p>
