  <p><strong>Red-shouldered hawk counting games.</strong> Enjoy counting? If you live in
  red-shouldered hawk country, count the number of <em>kee-aah</em> phrases in
  a single burst from one of these hawks. Just one tally can lead to
  questions. How many phrases are in the next series? And the next? How
  might these <em>kee-aah</em> outbursts vary through the day, or with the
  season, or when two hawks seem to answer each other? Given your close
  attention, you may discover other ways in which the birds vary their
  calling. Such information would be indispensable when trying to
  understand what the hawks are saying, and under what conditions, yet
  no one, not even professional ornithologists, has addressed these
  questions.</p>
