<p><strong>Song packages of yellow-throated vireos.</strong> These vireos are fascinating singers. The bird above in the book seemed to have two song packages, cut and dried, though more samples would have been needed to be certain of how he bundled his songs during extended performances. I have also heard a male repeat just one song more than a dozen times. What was that all about? Was that a "one-song package"? No two listens to these vireos are ever alike, and every singing bird deserves your ear. There is far more to explore among vireos, of course. Try your ears on the "solitary vireo" group&mdash;blue-headed (p. 169), Cassin's, and plumbeous vireos&mdash;for example. Listen to a Hutton's vireo, who rapidly repeats one simple song many times before switching to another, and you will inevitably ask why it is so different from the other vireos. For more vireo fun, see p. 143 for the warbling vireo, p. 164 for the Bell's vireo, and p. 77 for the white-eyed vireo.</p>
