<p><strong>Listening to female red-winged blackbirds.</strong> Red-winged blackbirds offer excellent listening opportunities. Get comfortable beside a local marsh where red-wings nest. Listen to the male sing, but then listen for the response from nearby females (two or more females might respond). Locate one female, perhaps foraging at water's edge, or maybe where she is building a nest or even incubating her eggs. Then listen intently for exactly when she responds to his singing. Is she more responsive after he has been quiet for a while? Is she most responsive during his first few songs, but then not so much after that, or when he changes the song he has been singing? (See "How a Repertoire Is Delivered," p. 94.) Does the probability of a response vary with time of day? What numbers could you collect to better understand the female's view of her world? Again, you are entering largely uncharted territory. Enjoy the exploring!</p>
