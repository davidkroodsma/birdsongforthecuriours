<p><strong><em>Chick-a-dee</em> calls of North American chickadees.</strong> Chickadees occur in one form or another throughout most of North America (besides the black-capped, the four others most frequently encountered are the Carolina, mountain, chestnut-backed, and boreal chickadees). They are common birds, especially at our winter feeders, and they all <em>chick-a-dee-dee-dee</em> in their own style (faster, slower, hoarser, etc.). Get to know chickadees better by counting the number of <em>dee</em> notes in their calls under a variety of circumstances. Then maybe try to manipulate the circumstance. Introduce a plastic owl near a feeder, for example, and listen to how the chickadees react. Or introduce a cat into the yard (but, heavens, only briefly!). Use your imagination as to what you think might be of concern to a chickadee, and then document how they adjust their <em>chick-a-dee</em> calls. You can practice your listening and counting with the <em>chick-a-dee</em> examples I provide on the website for the book.</p>
