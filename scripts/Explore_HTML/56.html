<p><strong>You can unravel the case of clay-colored sparrows.</strong> The rules for chipping, Brewer's, and field sparrows seem so straightforward for the dawn and daytime singing, but the singing of the clay-colored sparrow remains somewhat of an enigma. Yes, the clay-coloreds chip between songs during the dawn chorus, just like field and Brewer's sparrows (but unlike chipping sparrows), but is there any consistent difference between dawn songs and daytime songs? Any differences in duration, trill rate, buzzyness . . . anything? Somewhere, some curious naturalist will rise to the challenge and help answer these questions.</p>
