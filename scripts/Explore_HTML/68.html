<p><strong>Discovering new species by their songs.</strong> For many who love birds,discovering a new species is the ultimate quest, the ultimate find. InNorth America, here's a hot tip: Go to Vancouver Island and record thedrumming ruffed grouse there. Even the poorest quality recordings,done with a smart phone, will suffice. If all of the drummers thereare different from those of mainland North America, you have a strongcase for splitting the "Vancouver Island Ruffed Grouse" into anotherspecies. The grouse there and in adjacent areas of British Columbiaare already recognized as a distinct subspecies, based on plumage("dark and brownish with pronounced ventral barring," according to theBirds of North America). Given that the drums of grouse are almostcertainly innate and not learned, I place my bets on that grouse beinga different species. Better hurry, though, or you'll be scooped!</p>
