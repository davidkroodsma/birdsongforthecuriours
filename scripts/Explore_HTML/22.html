<p><strong>No dialects in the innate songs of flycatchers, doves, etc.</strong> Appreciate for yourself how songs of these birds remain relatively constant over much of the North American continent. For quail, doves, and flycatchers, listen to songs available on the internet and just try to find outlying geographic areas with distinctive songs. You won't find them, as you are hearing the power of the genes to guide song development into a very narrow outcome. Or if you do, chances are the professional ornithologists are aware of those differences and are contemplating whether the song differences are sufficient to split the outlying birds into a different species.</p>
