<p><strong>No dialects in the innate songs of flycatchers, doves, etc.</strong>Appreciate for yourself how songs of these birds remain relativelyconstant over much of the North American continent. For quail, doves,and flycatchers, listen to songs available on the internet and justtry to find outlying geographic areas with distinctive songs. Youwon't find them, as you are hearing the power of the genes to guidesong development into a very narrow outcome. Or if you do, chances arethe professional ornithologists are aware of those differences and arecontemplating whether the song differences are sufficient to split theoutlying birds into a different species.</p>
