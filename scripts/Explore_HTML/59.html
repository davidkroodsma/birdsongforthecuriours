<p><strong>Owling.</strong> Nearly 20 species of owls occur in North America, offering
plenty of nighttime listening for those so inclined. Owls who offer
great listening opportunities are the ubiquitous great horned owl (♫370,
♫453, ♫577) and the two screech-owls, eastern and western. A favorite of
many owlers, for their hair-raising, demoniacal caterwauling, is the
barred owl. Here's how you could get started: Around Christmas every
year, countless birders join the Christmas Bird Count throughout North
America, now extending into South America. Find the count organizers in
your area and join those "owlers" who will be out in the night, prowling
about for whatever owls they can find.</p>
