<p><strong>Song matching by neighboring western male marsh wrens.</strong> Somewherewest of the Great Plains, among western marsh wrens, settle in besidea marsh and focus on the singing of just one male (you can warm upwith this recording, almost an hour from one California male: ♫231).What an incredible variety of songs he delivers, each song almostalways different from the one before. Careful study would reveal thathe eventually repeats himself (as I have illustrated in ♫232),confirming that he has a discrete number of repeatable songs thatconstitute his large repertoire. Not only does he repeat particularsongs, but the song sequences are often the same as well (see♫233)---maybe that's one way for him to keep track of all his songs.</p>

<p>Now, as with the corvids, expand your listening to hear how twoneighbors interact. With a little time and patience, you will begin tohear the matching. Why and when they choose to match is unknown, andsometimes they match hardly at all. Why not? I wish we knew.</p>

<p>♫231: Nearly an hour of singing from one male. I did my best to holdthe parabolic reflector on him, but he at times escaped my aim for afew seconds. Enjoy the "raw" field recording---this is the best that Icould do with this male as he flew up and down the drainage ditchbeside the road. Enjoy a good, easy listen, but there's so much youcould do to search for patterns in this male's behavior. June 10,2018. Sierra Valley, California (58:16)</p>

♫232: Here's evidence that the male in the previous recording iscapable of repeating himself, i.e., that he has a set repertoire ofdiscrete song types that he can recall from memory and sing again.Four examples of one song type are extracted from the nearly hour-longrecording (the four renditions of this particular song were found at2:06, 9:18, 30:30, and 42:51; the song at 13:18 is slightlydifferent).

♫233: Not only does a male eventually repeat one of his songs, but thesequences in which he delivers his different songs are often the sameas well. Here, I've taken the four examples from ♫232 and included thenext two songs as well; careful listening (and sonagram study) revealsthat he sings A B C . . . A B C . . . A B D . . . A B D. Song A isalways followed by song B, which is followed by either C or D. June10, 2018. Sierra Valley, California. (0:42)</p>
