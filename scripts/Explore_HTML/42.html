<p><strong>Once you are attuned, <em>every singing bird</em> becomes interesting.</strong> Once
you are attuned to the different songs that a male can sing, <em>every
singing bird</em> becomes interesting. For those birds who routinely sing
with "eventual variety," you will be curious to know how many times a
male repeats a given song type before switching to another, and how the
patterns might change throughout the day, from the first songs of the
morning during the dawn chorus until well after the sun is up. Just how
does the male vary his presentation to express himself? As you listen,
you may come to agree that the more intense the singing, the more likely
it is that a male will switch to "immediate variety," with successive
songs all different, as with the eastern towhee, spotted towhee, and
black-throated sparrow examples above (see also "Energized Dawn
Singing," p. 112). Collect some numbers and quantify what you hear. How
many songs does he sing each minute, for example, and how many times
does he switch from one song type to another? Try plotting your numbers
on a graph, with "singing rate" and "percentage of different successive
songs" as your axes, and you will begin to see how he programs his
performance (see pages 118-119 for sample graphs for the red-winged
blackbird).</p>
