<p><strong>Flight songs of ovenbirds.</strong> The flight song of ovenbirds remainslargely a mystery. Oh, sure, it has been described by an ornithologistas occurring mostly around dawn and dusk, sometimes in the night, butthat's about all we know. The best way to find out would be todocument the pattern of its use throughout the breeding season (thoughI realize that's a lot of work!). From first arrival of males tocourting a female to egg-laying to incubation to caring for the youngto migrating south again, exactly when and how often during thenesting cycle do males engage in these flight songs? Documentingpatterns of use would be the first step toward understanding thefunctions of this fascinating behavior.</p>
