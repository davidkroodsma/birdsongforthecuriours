  <p><strong>Warbler dawn choruses are special.</strong> Warblers provide extraordinary
  listening opportunities. Many of them have specialized dawn and day
  songs, much like the yellow warbler (e.g., American redstart, p. 139;
  chestnut-sided warbler, p. 139; black-throated blue warbler, p. 28).
  Others seem not to care about such matters; they use the same songs
  during the dawn chorus as during any other circumstances throughout
  the day (common yellowthroat, p. 11; Tennessee warbler, p. 53;
  magnolia warbler, p. 54; ovenbird, p. 138). Pick your favorite
  warblers and go listen! What does a common yellowthroat, for example,
  do during the dawn chorus to show some passion that is not revealed
  during daytime singing? Are songs longer, or shorter, or delivered at
  a faster or slower or more continuous pace? Does a male engage in
  heated exchanges with neighboring territory owners? Listen to just a
  few warblers at dawn and you will be astonished at the variety of
  expression among them. Because of the early hour, most likely you will
  listen alone, revealing the reason we know so little about these
  warblers at dawn: Professional ornithologists like to sleep in too!</p>
