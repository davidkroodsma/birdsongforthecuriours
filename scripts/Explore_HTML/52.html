<p><strong>Warbler dawn choruses are special.</strong> Warblers provide extraordinarylistening opportunities. Many of them have specialized dawn and daysongs, much like the yellow warbler (e.g., American redstart, p. 139;chestnut-sided warbler, p. 139; black-throated blue warbler, p. 28).Others seem not to care about such matters; they use the same songsduring the dawn chorus as during any other circumstances throughoutthe day (common yellowthroat, p. 11; Tennessee warbler, p. 53;magnolia warbler, p. 54; ovenbird, p. 138). Pick your favoritewarblers and go listen! What does a common yellowthroat, for example,do during the dawn chorus to show some passion that is not revealedduring daytime singing? Are songs longer, or shorter, or delivered ata faster or slower or more continuous pace? Does a male engage inheated exchanges with neighboring territory owners? Listen to just afew warblers at dawn and you will be astonished at the variety ofexpression among them. Because of the early hour, most likely you willlisten alone, revealing the reason we know so little about thesewarblers at dawn: Professional ornithologists like to sleep in too!</p>
