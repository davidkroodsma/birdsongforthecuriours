  <p><strong>Birdsong and musicality.</strong> Pick any of these species and listen to
  them with new appreciation. What is it about each of them that strikes
  you as stunning, beautiful, exquisite, or choose your own adjective?
  Do you hear "music," however you choose to define it? For birds that
  sing high and fast, such as a Pacific wren, the music cannot be
  appreciated by our ears until we slow the songs and lower their
  frequency, and then the list of superlative singers expands
  enormously.</p>
