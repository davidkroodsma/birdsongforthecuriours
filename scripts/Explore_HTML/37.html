<p><strong>How phoebes use their two to three songs.</strong> Merely identifying the two
songs of the black phoebe, the two of the eastern phoebe, and the three
of the Say's phoebe is not enough, of course. Once you have identified
the songs, it's inevitable that you will ask yourself how they are used
in a performance. After you have explored the next section, "How a
Repertoire Is Delivered," chances are good that you will want to come
back to these phoebes, or at least think about how the songs are being
used whenever you encounter one in nature. For the eastern phoebe, you
will probably hear that the faster he sings the more likely he is to
alternate his two song forms. You can check that: Collect some numbers
from time to time on singing rates and how he uses his two song forms,
to see what <em>your</em> eastern phoebes do. Only the Say's phoebe has a
special song used at dawn. How does he work that into the sequences of
the other two songs? Does the black phoebe ever sing strings of one
song, followed by just a single example of the second, like the eastern
phoebe? Phoebes, even with their limited repertoire of songs, can
captivate the listening ear.</p>

<p>Other flycatchers mentioned elsewhere in this book also have limited
song repertoires: the alder flycatcher (p. 45) and least flycatcher (p.
79) have just one song apiece, the western wood-pewee (p. 148) and
eastern phoebe (p. 46) two songs, the eastern wood-pewee (p. 148) and
willow flycatcher (p. 45) three songs apiece. Many of the close
relatives of the alder and willow flycatchers in the genus <em>Empidonax</em>
have just two to three songs apiece (p. 151).</p>
