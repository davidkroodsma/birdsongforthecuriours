<p><strong>Get to know this wren!</strong> The recording of an entire dawn chorus byan individual is not easy to come by, but here are two dawns from thesame individual. Intrigued, I began asking questions, and answeringsome of the simpler ones. How many songs does he sing each morning? Ofhow many different types? For how many minutes each? How often does herepeat one of his songs before moving on to another? Any pattern inhow he calls between songs? There are so many ways to quantify what heis up to, and in the numbering and counting one comes to appreciatebetter the life of this singing being.</p>
