<p><strong>Individuality among red-winged blackbirds.</strong> How befuddling! As Iwas entranced by the male red-winged blackbird in this account, Iincreasingly realized that his neighbor barely sang throughout theentire dawn period. He seemed, in a word, passionless! He was alsopaired, and he and his mate foraged together on their territory, butwithout all the ruckus of their immediate neighbors. The strikingdifferences are mysterious, but perhaps could be explained if one knewmore about the two pairs. A simple description of how several malered-wings in a marsh behave through the dawn period would beenlightening, especially through the entire breeding season. Thatdescription would inevitably lead to better ideas as to why the malesdiffer so much in their behavior, and why they sing and call the waythey do during the predawn hour. Be aware: You may find no obviousreasons as to why the males differ, and may in the end just chalk upthe behavioral differences to their individual personalities.</p>
