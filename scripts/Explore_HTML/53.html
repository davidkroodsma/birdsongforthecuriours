<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Individuality among red-winged blackbirds.</strong> How befuddling! As I
  was entranced by the male red-winged blackbird in this account, I
  increasingly realized that his neighbor barely sang throughout the
  entire dawn period. He seemed, in a word, passionless! He was also
  paired, and he and his mate foraged together on their territory, but
  without all the ruckus of their immediate neighbors. The striking
  differences are mysterious, but perhaps could be explained if one knew
  more about the two pairs. A simple description of how several male
  red-wings in a marsh behave through the dawn period would be
  enlightening, especially through the entire breeding season. That
  description would inevitably lead to better ideas as to why the males
  differ so much in their behavior, and why they sing and call the way
  they do during the predawn hour. Be aware: You may find no obvious
  reasons as to why the males differ, and may in the end just chalk up
  the behavioral differences to their individual personalities.</p>
