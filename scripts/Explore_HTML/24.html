<p><strong>The practice singing of young songbirds.</strong> Search for young birds onyour own, at the best time of year to find them where you live. In theNortheast, I begin listening carefully during August. I find a birdyplace and just stand quietly, perhaps with eyes closed, concentrating,listening for anything out of the ordinary. The first musings of youngmale birds are oh so soft and amorphous, so easily overlooked, and ifheard might not even be identifiable to species. Their effortsgradually improve, however, and by September and October, songs canalready be very adultlike. But there is always some irregularity inthe songs of these young birds, something that gives them away.Perhaps it's a wavering note, or a sudden break in frequency wherethere should be none. Or, for a species in which a given song istypically delivered many times, successive songs are slightly tohilariously different, as the song has not yet been mastered.</p>
