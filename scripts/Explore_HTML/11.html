<p><strong><em>Peent</em>ing and <em>VROOM</em>ing common nighthawks.</strong> I wonder, how many
times does he <em>peent</em> before each display dive? How might that pattern
change over time? The low-frequency <em>VROOOM</em> carries great distances
from neighboring territories, so I could also hear if a male chooses to
<em>VROOOM</em> just after one of his neighbors, or if they coordinate or
adjust the timing of their booming display dives in any way.</p>
