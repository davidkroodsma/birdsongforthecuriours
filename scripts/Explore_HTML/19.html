  <p><strong>Memories of birds and human listeners. Test both your memory <em>and</em>
  that of a singing bird. Find a thrasher (or a relative, such as a
  catbird or mockingbird) who sings endlessly, and listen to him until
  you hear a sound so distinct that you will be sure to recognize it
  when he sings it again. Then begin your Big Listen. Start your
  stopwatch, or count the number of songs until you hear your chosen
  song again, or do both. How long did it take him to return to your
  chosen song? How many other songs did he sing in the meantime? Or, in
  case you can't get out to find your own singing bird, use the long
  recordings I provide for a number of species, such as the red-eyed
  vireo (p. 98), gray catbird (p. 49), brown thrasher (p. 92), northern
  mockingbird (p. 73), sage thrasher (p. 83), and western meadowlark (p.
  150).</strong></p>
