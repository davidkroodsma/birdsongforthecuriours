<p><strong>Memories of birds and human listeners. Test both your memory <em>and</em>that of a singing bird. Find a thrasher (or a relative, such as acatbird or mockingbird) who sings endlessly, and listen to him untilyou hear a sound so distinct that you will be sure to recognize itwhen he sings it again. Then begin your Big Listen. Start yourstopwatch, or count the number of songs until you hear your chosensong again, or do both. How long did it take him to return to yourchosen song? How many other songs did he sing in the meantime? Or, incase you can't get out to find your own singing bird, use the longrecordings I provide for a number of species, such as the red-eyedvireo (p. 98), gray catbird (p. 49), brown thrasher (p. 92), northernmockingbird (p. 73), sage thrasher (p. 83), and western meadowlark (p.150).</strong></p>
