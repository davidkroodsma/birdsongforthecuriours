<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Prairie flight songs.</strong> Nesting side by side in the shortgrass
  prairie of the northern Great Plains, with not a song perch in sight,
  the McCown's longspur and lark bunting offer wonderful opportunities
  for exploring what flight songs are all about. Stake out a pair or two
  during the daytime, and then return well before sunrise. What patterns
  in the song flights can be documented through the first couple of
  hours of a morning's activity? Do these flight singers reveal any
  special passion during the dawn chorus when perched singers are at
  their most intense? How many flights? For what duration? How do flight
  songs compare with perched songs? The numbers you choose to collect
  will tell you much about the lives of these flight singers.</p>
