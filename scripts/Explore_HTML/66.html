<p><strong>Just when do birds sing in flight?</strong> At one time or another, perhapsall individuals of all species sing in flight. For most species it isjust a routine song while the bird flies from one perch to another,and of no special significance. But then there are the highlydistinctive flight songs, such as those by western meadowlarks, thatare heard only rarely. Ditto for the occasional flight song of thecommon yellowthroat, delivered in butterfly-flight with quiveringwings and bobbing tail. We know so little about those songs. What arethe circumstances under which they are used? Many flight songs soundecstatic and jumbled, making one wonder if the overall delivery isimprovised on the spot or whether the flight song is as stereotypedand constant as the perched songs. Multiple renditions of a flightsong from one individual, such as ovenbird, western meadowlark, orcommon yellowthroat, would tell whether the complex song is improvisedeach time or memorized and stored in the brain.</p>
