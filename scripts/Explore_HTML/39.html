<p><strong>Seeing the magnificence of hermit thrush songs.</strong> Even more satisfying than listening to a hermit thrush is to both listen and see his songs simultaneously. Import one of the hermit thrush recordings into Raven Lite. Then pick a unique, recognizable song and <em>see</em> how it resurfaces about ten songs later. If you print 20 to 30 sonagrams and sort them, you will come up with about ten distinctly different piles, indicating that each of the male's songs is well practiced and committed to memory. While in Raven Lite, play the songs at slower speeds, and backward, too.</p>
