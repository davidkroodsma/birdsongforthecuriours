<p>♫53. Duetting male and female. Her seven-second <em>pit pit pit</em> song
(always without the rapid terminal <em>tr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r</em>)
overlaps the first two male songs; in a second example, her song is more
distant, and is given between the two male songs (0:38 to 0:42). March
12, 2017. Montaña de Oro State Park, Los Osos, California. (0:51)
Recorded by Janet Grenzke.</p>
