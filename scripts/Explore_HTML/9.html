<p><strong>Singing from the nest by cardinals and grosbeaks.</strong> How fascinatingthat the female northern cardinal and both the male and femalerose-breasted (and black-headed) grosbeaks sing from the nest whileincubating or brooding the young! Why?, one inevitably asks. Wouldn'ttheir singing reveal the nest's location to predators? Somecommunicative advantage must outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>Find a nest of one of these species and settle comfortably nearby, farenough away of course that you don't disturb the nesting birds.Cardinal nests are most easily found by following the female, whochips like a Geiger counter as she returns to the nest. Grosbeak nestsare may be most readily found by listening to the male singing from aconstant location over several minutes, often well-hidden in lowbushes.</p>

<p>Questions abound: When does the female cardinal sing from the nest?Only or primarily when the male is nearby? Does he then come to thenest, perhaps to deliver food? Does he chip, or sing? If he sings, dothey match each other's songs (see page xx)? And how about thegrosbeaks? When does the female sing? By herself, with the male out ofearshot, or only with the male nearby, perhaps signaling that shewould like or at least anticipates relief, with him taking over nestduties while she takes a break? And just listen to him sing from thenest! Be forewarned: Not all pairs behave the same. I have settled innext to two rose-breasted grosbeak nests; the male and female werehighly vocal at one nest, but relatively silent at the second. Again:Why?</p>
