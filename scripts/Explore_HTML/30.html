<p><strong>Dialects in black-capped chickadee songs.</strong> Everywhere you travel inblack-capped chickadee country, listen carefully. Are you in the<em>hey-sweetie</em> dialect region? Be sure to get close enough to yoursinger so that you can hear that slight waver between the twosyllables of the <em>sweetie</em> note (p. 8); if you are too distant, thereverberation from the <em>sweet</em> bouncing off vegetation between you andthe singer can obscure that waver. For a special chickadee encounter,experience one of those strikingly different dialects in westernWashington or Oregon. Or try those odd dialects on East Coast islands,such as Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket. Listen wherever you travelthroughout North America and maybe you will discover yet another localdialect, different from the <em>hey-sweetie</em>s, such as someone did inFort Collins, Colorado.</p>

<p>We are going off topic here, but we take listening experiences wherewe find them: Listen again to the chickadee and the spotted towhee inâ™«257. How often do the two males of these two different speciesoverlap their songs? They mostly alternate, don't they, overlappingfar less often than if they were ignoring each other? Each birdclearly seems to be trying to avoid the interference of the other. Orit is possible that one bird is the dominant singer, and the secondbird inserts his songs into the silent spaces between the songs of theother. If you are numerically inclined, you could collect some numbersto demonstrate the extent to which overlap of songs is avoided. Whenattuned to how nearby singing males often avoid interference with eachother, you will hear this phenomenon more often. Keep listening!</p>
