<blockquote>
  <p><strong>American robin songs.</strong> Discover something about robins that no one
  else seems to have explored. A robin sings "several" low, caroled
  phrases in a series before pausing or offering a high, screechy note
  (a <em>hisselly</em>, though some hear it as <em>eek</em>), but exactly how many
  carols does he sing? Or how many <em>eek</em>s? Do the numbers change through
  a singing session, or from early morning to midmorning to midday to
  afternoon to evening? Or from one week or month to the next? And how
  about the ratio of carols to <em>eek</em>s? What might you learn about the
  mind of a robin by simply counting his songs like this? No one yet
  knows.</p>
  
  <p>You can listen to patterns in robin singing anywhere and everywhere,
  as suggested above, thereby documenting a general pattern in robin
  singing for whatever time scale you choose. Even more satisfying,
  however, might be to learn how an individual robin sings over time.
  Many robins can be recognized as individuals by a unique carol or two
  (see "How a Repertoire Is Delivered," p. 94), and you can use those
  unique carols to ensure that you are listening to the same robin from
  hour to hour or day to day.</p>
