<p><strong>Tuning your ears to hear mimicry.</strong> Recognizing mimicry is difficult for the beginner who has a limited ability to identify species by their songs or calls. One possibility is to find an expert birder at a local bird club and have him or her identify the mimicry with you. Another possibility is to learn to recognize the distinctive calls of a particular species, such as the wood thrush's <em>whit-whit</em>, and then listen for that specific call in the white-eyed vireo's song. Where in the song does it occur? Do vireos in south Florida have the <em>whit</em> calls in their songs, even though wood thrushes don't breed there? Or how often do starling songs begin with the asthmatic scream of a red-tailed hawk? Or, more challenging, can you solve the mystery of when and why jays mimic hawks (below)?</p>

<p>Do all mockingbirds in the neighborhood share the same mimicked songs? Is the mocker more likely to mimic, say, an eastern phoebe, if the phoebe is singing simultaneously nearby? I have often wondered if I could teach a mockingbird a song that I repeatedly played to it. I would choose some of their favorite songs as models, a western rock wren for an eastern mocker, an eastern Carolina wren for a western mocker, because then I would know for sure that I was the source of their mimicr&mdash;if, that is, they copied the songs I broadcasted into the neighborhood over my loudspeakers.</p>
