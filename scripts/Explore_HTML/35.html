<p><strong>Tuning your ears to hear mimicry.</strong> Recognizing mimicry is difficultfor the beginner who has a limited ability to identify species bytheir songs or calls. One possibility is to find an expert birder at alocal bird club and have him or her identify the mimicry with you.Another possibility is to learn to recognize the distinctive calls ofa particular species, such as the wood thrush\'s <em>whit-whit</em>, and thenlisten for that specific call in the white-eyed vireo\'s song. Wherein the song does it occur? Do vireos in south Florida have the <em>whit</em>calls in their songs, even though wood thrushes don\'t breed there? Orhow often do starling songs begin with the asthmatic scream of ared-tailed hawk? Or, more challenging, can you solve the mystery ofwhen and why jays mimic hawks (below)?</p>

<p>Do all mockingbirds in the neighborhood share the same mimicked songs?Is the mocker more likely to mimic, say, an eastern phoebe, if thephoebe is singing simultaneously nearby? I have often wondered if Icould teach a mockingbird a song I repeatedly played to it. I wouldchoose some of their favorite songs as models, a western rock wren foran eastern mocker, an eastern Carolina wren for a western mocker,because then I would know for sure that I was the source of theirmimicry---if , that is, they copied the songs I broadcasted into theneighborhood over my loudspeakers.</p>
