<p><strong>Sage thrasher songs, through the night.</strong> How (and when, where, why)birds sing in the night puts us in largely uncharted territory. Forthree nights, from the evening of June 12 to the morning of June 15,2018, I placed a SWIFT recorder (see "Recording birdsong," p. 179)near a male's night roost. He obliged with an outpouring of song, andfor two mornings I followed him after he left his night roost, toenable a comparison of his "day" songs with his "night" songs(♫518-531).</p>

<p>You can use these recordings to explore so many questions that arecurrently unanswered: Exactly when in the night does he sing? Is itthe same pattern night after night? How do night songs compare to daysongs, in duration, complexity, or whatever other measure you can comeup with? In just a quick sampling of songs from ♫523, just aftermidnight on 14 June, I was astonished to see that this free-wheelingbird that I knew from the daytime, who sang what seemed an endlessvariety of songs, was <em>repeating himself</em>, with successive songs attimes identical! Compare songs at 8:14 and 8:58, for example, or thetwo at 14:14 and 15:24, or the five-second songs at 24:06 and 24:44. Idid not realize that a sage thrasher was capable of repeating himselflike this.</p>

<p>I love listening for mimicry: soras, barn swallows, so many more.After marveling at the enormous variety of sounds, I pick one that Ican readily distinguish from all the others, such as the twopure-toned notes that sound like the introductory notes of a vespersparrow song&mdash;-in ♫528, hear them at 1:36, 2:37, and 3:48. Then I tryto find them again. Want to join me in the search? The search isfaster if you scroll through the sonagrams in Raven Lite, withoutactually listening. Any luck finding where those particular notesrecur? What have you learned about sage thrashers in the process?</p>

♫518. Here is a good sample of dawn singing after the male leaves hisnight singing roost. In the distance, hear one song from this male'snight perch (from 0:02-0:17); by 0:25 he is flying toward where themicrophone will record him for the next 99 minutes! 4:50-6:29<small style="font-size: 75%">A.M.]{.SMALLCAPS} SUNRISE, 5:33 [A.M.</small> June 12, 2018.Sierra Valley, California (1:38:37)</p>

A greatdistance away (about one hundred yards or more) so that the microphonewould not pick him up? My best guess is that he was in place and quiet. . . but that seems so unlike what he did the previous two nights.(19:14)</p>

<p>Perhaps a confession is in order. The night singing was recorded by aSWIFT recorder (monaural; see p. xx in the book for the recording gearI use) placed near the bird's night roost. I was not there. On twomornings I arrived about 4 <small style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</small> to be ready for hissinging once he departed his night roost; those songs, when he was onthe fence posts beside the road, were recorded with a stereo shotgunmicrophone (AudioTechnica BP4029). I wasn't there then either! I wasoff listening to western meadowlarks, marsh wrens, yellow-headedblackbirds, and whatever else was singing. The sage thrasherpredictably sang from the same perches, so he took care of recordinghimself.</p>
