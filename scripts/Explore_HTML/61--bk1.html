  <p><strong>Sage thrasher songs, through the night.</strong> How (and when, where, why)
  birds sing in the night puts us in largely uncharted territory. For
  three nights, from the evening of June 12 to the morning of June 15,
  2018, I placed a SWIFT recorder (see "Recording birdsong," p. 179)
  near a male's night roost. He obliged with an outpouring of song, and
  for two mornings I followed him after he left his night roost, to
  enable a comparison of his "day" songs with his "night" songs
  (♫518-531).</p>
  
  <p>You can use these recordings to explore so many questions that are
  currently unanswered: Exactly when in the night does he sing? Is it
  the same pattern night after night? How do night songs compare to day
  songs, in duration, complexity, or whatever other measure you can come
  up with? In just a quick sampling of songs from ♫523, just after
  midnight on 14 June, I was astonished to see that this free-wheeling
  bird that I knew from the daytime, who sang what seemed an endless
  variety of songs, was <em>repeating himself</em>, with successive songs at
  times identical! Compare songs at 8:14 and 8:58, for example, or the
  two at 14:14 and 15:24, or the five-second songs at 24:06 and 24:44. I
  did not realize that a sage thrasher was capable of repeating himself
  like this.</p>
  
  <p>I love listening for mimicry: soras, barn swallows, so many more.
  After marveling at the enormous variety of sounds, I pick one that I
  can readily distinguish from all the others, such as the two
  pure-toned notes that sound like the introductory notes of a vesper
  sparrow song---in ♫528, hear them at 1:36, 2:37, and 3:48. Then I try
  to find them again. Want to join me in the search? The search is
  faster if you scroll through the sonagrams in Raven Lite, without
  actually listening. Any luck finding where those particular notes
  recur? What have you learned about sage thrashers in the process?</p>

  <p>♫518. Here is a good sample of dawn singing after the male leaves his
  night singing roost. In the distance, hear one song from this male's
  night perch (from 0:02-0:17); by 0:25 he is flying toward where the
  microphone will record him for the next 99 minutes! 4:50-6:29

  [a.m.]{.smallcaps}? Still in his night perch and quiet? A great
  distance away (about one hundred yards or more) so that the microphone
  would not pick him up? My best guess is that he was in place and quiet
  . . . but that seems so unlike what he did the previous two nights.

  <p>Perhaps a confession is in order. The night singing was recorded by a
  SWIFT recorder (monaural; see p. xx in the book for the recording gear
  I use) placed near the bird's night roost. I was not there. On two
  mornings I arrived about 4 [a.m.]{.smallcaps} to be ready for his
  singing once he departed his night roost; those songs, when he was on
  the fence posts beside the road, were recorded with a stereo shotgun
  microphone (AudioTechnica BP4029). I wasn't there then either! I was
  off listening to western meadowlarks, marsh wrens, yellow-headed
  blackbirds, and whatever else was singing. The sage thrasher
  predictably sang from the same perches, so he took care of recording
  himself.</p>
