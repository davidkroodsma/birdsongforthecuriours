<p><strong>The joy of western meadowlark songs.</strong> Want to explore these western meadowlarks some more? Come along with me to Sierra Valley in eastern California where, during 2018, I just couldn't get enough of them (for meadowlark lovers everywhere, over four and a half hours of recordings are provided here!). One male (call him Bird 1) offered plenty of listening material. Try warming up with ♫620 for nearly nine minutes of song. Hear how repetitive he is, beginning in the following pattern: A B B B B B C C C C C D D D D D D E E E E E E . . . plus another 34 songs. In ♫621 you will find another 138 songs from the same male, these two recordings spanning sunrise. Altogether, in these 195 songs the male revealed a repertoire of 13 different songs; in ♫622 I have copied two renditions of each of the 13, so that you can quickly listen to his entire repertoire.</p>

<p>For more from that same bird two days later, try ♫623 for another 8 minutes. Or ♫624 for <em>an hour and a half</em> spanning sunrise (unedited&mdash;sometimes the male is far, sometimes near, with cattle, of course; feel the "you-are-there" experience as it was recorded in the field!). Hear how Bird 1 and a meadowlark in the distance match songs on occasion (e.g., from 1:24:11 to 1:24:35)? What else do you hear? For even more from this meadowlark, listen to ♫625 for another two hours!</p>

<p>There is also Bird 2, the immediate neighbor of Bird 1 (♫626, ♫627). These two neighbors share at least four songs in their repertoires, as heard in ♫628, where matching songs from the two birds are played back to back (i.e., they can and do learn their songs from each other). And, yes, there's also Bird 3 (♫629), should you ask.</p>

<p>Taken together, these recordings offer a marvelous opportunity to explore what western meadowlark singing is all about!</p>
