  <p><strong>Indefatigable, bachelor males advertising for a mate.</strong> For a week
  or two during early spring, get to know a singing male by documenting
  his singing effort to attract a mate to his territory. Males typically
  return from migration before females; each male establishes his
  territory and then, until a female joins him, he is a bachelor and
  typically sings all day long. Enjoy all-nighters? Find a local
  nightjar. Don't limit yourself to whip-poor-wills, but consider their
  relatives, such as a chuck-will's-widow or a common poorwill. Or
  choose a songbird just returning from migration; warblers are
  fascinating, because many species use different songs in advertising
  for females and in fighting with males (e.g., yellow warbler, p. 115).
  If you don't want to choose a particular species, you could document
  the decline in singing for all species in an area by simply counting
  the number of songs or singing birds that can be heard during a
  selected time period each morning (e.g., a 15-minute block of time
  each day beginning at 9 [a.m.]{.smallcaps}).</p>
  
  <p>Among some species, each male attempts to attract several mates (a
  mating system known as "polygyny"), and as a result his singing (or
  "displaying") can continue unabated throughout the nesting season. He
  is, in effect, always seeking a mate to father more young. Below are
  three examples, in addition to nine mentioned elsewhere in other
  conÂ­texts in the book: ruffed grouse (p. 141), Anna's hummingbird (p.
  69), broad-tailed hummingbird (p. 22), American woodcock (p. 130),
  sedge wren (pp. 48, 91, 144, 159), marsh wren (pp. 34, 60), bobolink
  (p. 68), red-winged blackbird (pp. 18, 70, 117), and great-tailed
  grackle (pp. 109, 166).</p>
