<p><strong>The curious case of pitch-shifting black-capped chickadees.</strong> Whypitch-shift? And when? Is this form of singing simply another way fora male songbird to interact with singing neighbors? Other songbirds,such as cardinals (p. 59), learn about a dozen different songs fromeach other and then often match each other during their countersingingexchanges. Perhaps chickadees play some of the same kinds of gamesthat cardinals do; it's just that when chickadees match, they arematching the pitch of their one <em>hey-sweetie</em> song. What fun listeningto a community of black-capped chickadees pitch-shifting during thedawn hour, all the while asking questions.</p>

<p>What pitch is he on now? How many songs does he sing on a pitch beforeshifting? How does that change over time? And his neighbor? Doneighbors pitch-shift at about the same time, and to a similar or adifferent pitch? Can I detect any patterns? This exercise isfacilitated by the chickadees, because during the dawn chorus, malechickadees often gather to countersing near territory boundaries (asdo males of so many songbirds), so that two or more birds can easilybe heard simultaneously.</p>
