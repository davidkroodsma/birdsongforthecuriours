<p><strong>Song packages of the Philadelphia vireo.</strong> To learn more of thesinging program of this vireo, one needs recordings longer than I havefrom one individual. Will more extensive recordings confirm that heroutinely sings in song packages? If so, how many packages does a malehave? How stable are the packages over time? Do the song types usedwithin a package remain the same, but the favored sequence changesfrom one occurrence to another (as in ♫431 and ♫432)? And how aboutother Philadelphia vireos in the same neighborhood? How do their songrepertoires and packages compare? Are the songs all different, as onewould expect for the red-eyed vireo, or are many of the songs amongneighbors the same, a result of song imitation? One could beginexploring longer recordings of this vireo on the internet (e.g.,<a href="https://www.xeno-canto.org/">https://www.xeno-canto.org/</a>, <a href="https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/">https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/</a>),but almost certainly original recordings will be needed to sort allthis out, as the relatively brief, random recordings currentlyavailable will not suffice.</p>
