<p><strong>Listening for patterns in how songbirds present their songrepertoires.</strong> By now, your ears are well tuned for fine listening.With every singing bird, you will subconsciously listen to the patternin each song, comparing it to the next, and the next, wonderingexactly how the bird is moving through whatever songs he knows. Youwill be listening for a unique song (a "handle") that you areconfident you will recognize if you hear it again, and you will pauselong enough to get a sense of at least the short-term use of thatparticular song. You will linger more often, wondering when such aunique song might recur, perhaps even staying with a singing bird forhours on end. Without even thinking, you will be asking questions, andanswering many of them, more and more effortlessly exploring the worldof birdsong. It's a good life!</p>

<p>Fifty years ago I knew a graduate student, coincidentally named Robin,who was going to "do" reptiles because everything was known aboutbirds. I have friends who are "doing" butterflies or dragonfliesbecause they have "done" birds. Now, there's nothing wrong withreptiles, butterflies, or dragonflies, of course, but the birds I knowoffer limitless opportunities, with so little known about them!</p>
