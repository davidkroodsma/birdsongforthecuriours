  <p><strong>Listening for patterns in how songbirds present their song
  repertoires.</strong> By now, your ears are well tuned for fine listening.
  With every singing bird, you will subconsciously listen to the pattern
  in each song, comparing it to the next, and the next, wondering
  exactly how the bird is moving through whatever songs he knows. You
  will be listening for a unique song (a "handle") that you are
  confident you will recognize if you hear it again, and you will pause
  long enough to get a sense of at least the short-term use of that
  particular song. You will linger more often, wondering when such a
  unique song might recur, perhaps even staying with a singing bird for
  hours on end. Without even thinking, you will be asking questions, and
  answering many of them, more and more effortlessly exploring the world
  of birdsong. It's a good life!</p>
  
  <p>Fifty years ago I knew a graduate student, coincidentally named Robin,
  who was going to "do" reptiles because everything was known about
  birds. I have friends who are "doing" butterflies or dragonflies
  because they have "done" birds. Now, there's nothing wrong with
  reptiles, butterflies, or dragonflies, of course, but the birds I know
  offer limitless opportunities, with so little known about them!</p>
