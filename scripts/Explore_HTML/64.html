<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dawn song flights of tree swallows.</strong> To hear the tree swallows in
  dawn song, head out well before sunrise to where you know they are
  nesting in the birdhouses someone has erected, perhaps in an open
  field or above a marsh or wetland. With the show beginning so early,
  in the dark, you have no hope of initially seeing the bird in action,
  but hear him you do. Try to follow one individual throughout the
  entire dawn effort---perhaps his songs are distinctive, different from
  those of other nearby airborne swallows. Document the best you can
  what he does. By now, you have a pretty good idea of the numbers you
  might collect to describe his behavior: number of songs per minute,
  and how that changes over time; his flight path, the circuit he takes
  around his nest box; how often he does this or that . . .</p>
