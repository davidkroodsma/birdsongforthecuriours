<p>The ultimate listening experience begins here; see book text for details
on how to listen to these several song selections. Briefly, three and a
quarter hours from the same male are recorded in ♫411-417. In ♫#418 and
♫419, I provide the ten imitations of other species that I used to
estimate this male's repertoire (about 1300 songs!).</p>
