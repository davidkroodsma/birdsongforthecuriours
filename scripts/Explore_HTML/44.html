  <p><strong>Listening for chat song packages.</strong> Do the chat's "song packages"
  have a stable composition? For the bird in â™«433, for example, are the
  <em>BOB</em> and <em>WHITE</em> notes always in the same package, together with the
  other three sounds? It might take hours of listening to a single chat
  to find out, as you would have to wait for him to return to the <em>BOB</em>
  and <em>WHITE</em> notes after he delivered all manner of other sounds. All
  it would take is some time and fine listening to learn how the singing
  chat stores and organizes the songs in his brain. As of now, it's
  uncharted territory.</p>
