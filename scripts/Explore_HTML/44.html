<p><strong>Listening for chat song packages.</strong> Do the chat's "song packages"have a stable composition? For the bird in â™«433, for example, are the<em>BOB</em> and <em>WHITE</em> notes always in the same package, together with theother three sounds? It might take hours of listening to a single chatto find out, as you would have to wait for him to return to the <em>BOB</em>and <em>WHITE</em> notes after he delivered all manner of other sounds. Allit would take is some time and fine listening to learn how the singingchat stores and organizes the songs in his brain. As of now, it'suncharted territory.</p>
