<p><strong>Winnows of Wilson's snipe.</strong> It is great fun to follow a snipe highoverhead as he circles about, from one swooping dive to the next,seemingly intent on stitching heaven to earth. Once airborne, how longdoes he remain aloft, and how many display dives does he complete?Does he have favorite places to dive? Is there any effort tocoordinate his display dive with those of a neighbor? So manyquestions, but as yet no answers.</p>
