<p><strong>Scaling song complexity.</strong> My scale for complexity is entirelyarbitrary. Maybe you could come up with your own scale. What if youtried to rate all the singers in your neighborhood by song durationalone? Or by the number of different "sections" that you hear in asong? Or by tonal quality, or buzzyness, or some other measure ofhuman musicality? Think about it. Classifying the songs in somefashion helps us appreciate the variety among birds, though of courseit's irrelevant to the birds themselves. Two other facets ofcomplexity are how many different songs a male has and how those songsare delivered during a performance (see next two sections).</p>
