**When and why do chimney swifts twitter?** Just when do chimneyswifts twitter? When they are flying all alone, or flying with others,or when they meet other swifts on a flyby? Learning *when* they callwill provide hints as to *why* they call. As with so many explorationsI suggest in this book, you are on your own, as I can find no evidencethat anyone has been curious enough to ask, much less answer, thesesimple questions of chimney swifts.
