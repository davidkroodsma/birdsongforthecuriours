**Develop your own list of favored musicians.** In your own growinglist of favored musicians, maybe each is associated with some specialtime and place in your life, and that's all it takes. I have toconfess, though you probably knew all along: These last few "author'schoice" birds are special to me, but hardly more so than all the otherbirds in this book. Listening to me enthuse about birdsong on aten-week bicycle ride from Virginia to Oregon, my son finally asked,"But how can all birds be the most spectacular?" "It's just the way itis," I explained fully. After 50 years of intensive listening, I findeach species and *each individual* fascinating, and the honest answerto the question "Which is your favorite?" is "The bird I'm listeningto now."
