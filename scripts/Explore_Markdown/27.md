**Call matching by ravens, jays, and other corvids.** With a raven orany of his corvid relatives (members of the family Corvidae are*everywhere*, and include jays, scrub-jays, magpies, the nutcracker,and crows---see page 174), focus first on the calls of one individual.Realize that from its vast repertoire of calls, it has chosen one withthese particular qualities for the occasion. Then, when you are ready,expand your field of hearing to what other individuals of the speciesare doing. Do they "agree" or "disagree" with each other? If your birdchanges its call, does it do so to match the other birds, or do theymatch it? What patterns emerge over time?
