**Exploring birdsong with human musicians.** Musicians with good ears, especially those with perfect pitch, often hear far more than those of us with normal, untrained ears. You can listen all you want with your own ears, of course, but try borrowing those of a musician friend (along with the friend, of course). Listening with a trained musician can be an ear-opener!
