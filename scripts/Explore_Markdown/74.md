**Exploring birdsong with human musicians.** Musicians with good ears,especially those with perfect pitch, often hear far more than those ofus with normal, untrained ears. You can listen all you want with yourown ears, of course, but try borrowing those of a musician friend(along with the friend, of course). Listening with a trained musiciancan be an ear-opener!
