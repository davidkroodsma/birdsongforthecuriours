**Recognizing individuals by their songs.** The more you listen, themore you will hear, and often without really trying all that hard. Toget to know individual birds by their songs, begin with the easiertask of focusing on birds who have only one song in their repertoire(see pages 86-87 for lists of candidate species). Listen to song aftersong from one individual, coming to know the rhythm and overallquality, and especially coming to appreciate the range of variationwithin his song. Then listen to his neighbor, and you will often findsomething different that will enable you to tell the two birds apart.The challenge is far greater, of course, when the birds have learnedtheir songs from each other, so that they sing almost identical songsfrom the same small or large dialect (e.g., some neighboring chippingsparrows, common yellowthroats, indigo buntings, pp. 56-58; or birdswho belong to larger dialects, such as white-crowned sparrows (p. 64)and black-capped chickadees (p. 64). The challenge is also great withflycatchers, as songs vary less from individual to individual thanthey do in the song-learning songbirds.
