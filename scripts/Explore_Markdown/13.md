**The "double-strike" of sapsuckers.** Unable to hear the "doublestrike" of the sapsucker's bill after the introductory roll? Soundslike just one strike to you? I admit it sounds like one strike to mealso, but there is a way to hear it better. Give this a try: Importinto Raven Lite (see book page 3) one of the yellow-bellied sapsuckerrecordings (the best is â™«72) so that you can now at least see thedouble strike, the bill actually hitting the substrate twice in rapidsuccession. The second strike is not so loud, but it's clearly thereand not merely an echo of the first. Now, instead of playing the drumin the normal fashion, play it backwards. The softer "second" strikeis now audible before the loud "first" strike. It's as if our ears areprogrammed to interpret a second softer sound as an irrelevant echo ofthe first, so we hear only the first and dismiss the second. Playingother bird sounds backwards offers great entertainment in dullmoments!
