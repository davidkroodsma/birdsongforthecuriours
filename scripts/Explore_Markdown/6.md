> **Red-shouldered hawk counting games.** Enjoy counting? If you live in
> red-shouldered hawk country, count the number of *kee-aah* phrases in
> a single burst from one of these hawks. Just one tally can lead to
> questions. How many phrases are in the next series? And the next? How
> might these *kee-aah* outbursts vary through the day, or with the
> season, or when two hawks seem to answer each other? Given your close
> attention, you may discover other ways in which the birds vary their
> calling. Such information would be indispensable when trying to
> understand what the hawks are saying, and under what conditions, yet
> no one, not even professional ornithologists, has addressed these
> questions.
