**Mockingbird calls at dusk and dawn.** You will find plenty of dawnlistening during the breeding season (see next two sections), sohere's some good listening that you can try during those long monthsof the year when birds aren\'t breeding, when they are singing little,if at all, and relatively quiet. One of my favorite dawn and duskexperiences is with the mockingbird, as it is so loud and intense atboth dawn and dusk. Plus, they are abundant throughout the East andthe South all the way to the Pacific. Begin walking among mockingbirdterritories around sunset, and continue until all is quiet, all thewhile mapping out places from which the mockingbirds call intensely.Then, well before sunrise, return to the same area and hear the sameprocess in reverse when those mockingbirds awake, in much the same waythey went to roost, growling harshly.
