***Peent*ing and *VROOM*ing common nighthawks.** I wonder, how many
times does he *peent* before each display dive? How might that pattern
change over time? The low-frequency *VROOOM* carries great distances
from neighboring territories, so I could also hear if a male chooses to
*VROOOM* just after one of his neighbors, or if they coordinate or
adjust the timing of their booming display dives in any way.
