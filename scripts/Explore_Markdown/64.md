**Dawn song flights of tree swallows.** To hear the tree swallows indawn song, head out well before sunrise to where you know they arenesting in the birdhouses someone has erected, perhaps in an openfield or above a marsh or wetland. With the show beginning so early,in the dark, you have no hope of initially seeing the bird in action,but hear him you do. Try to follow one individual throughout theentire dawn effort---perhaps his songs are distinctive, different fromthose of other nearby airborne swallows. Document the best you canwhat he does. By now, you have a pretty good idea of the numbers youmight collect to describe his behavior: number of songs per minute,and how that changes over time; his flight path, the circuit he takesaround his nest box; how often he does this or that . . .
