**You can unravel the case of clay-colored sparrows.** The rules forchipping, Brewer's, and field sparrows seem so straightforward for thedawn and daytime singing, but the singing of the clay-colored sparrowremains somewhat of an enigma. Yes, the clay-coloreds chip betweensongs during the dawn chorus, just like field and Brewer's sparrows(but unlike chipping sparrows), but is there any consistent differencebetween dawn songs and daytime songs? Any differences in duration,trill rate, buzzyness . . . anything? Somewhere, some curiousnaturalist will rise to the challenge and help answer these questions.
