**White-breasted nuthatch songs.** A male white-breasted nuthatch isbelieved to have just two songs, one slow, one fast, and he repeatsone song many times before switching to his other (see "How aRepertoire Is Delivered," p. 94). But how many times? Does he favorone song over the other? Just a few minutes of concentrated countingwith a nuthatch will take you places where it seems that no one beforehas explored.

A more advanced project for the curious naturalist might ask if allbirds in a population sing at the same slow and fast rates. You willneed to record and measure songs, all readily doable if you areinterested (see p. 179). I have wanted to do this project for years,as I have suspected that "just two songs per male, one fast and oneslow" is oversimplified and might not accurately reflect whatnuthatches actually do (see also p. 169, on the red-breastednuthatch). This listening project is good for late winter or earlyspring, as nuthatches have an especially early singing season.
