That\'s thebest way to hear the dickcissel dialects as you move quickly from birdto bird, and from dialect to dialect. Get to know a fairly small areaand plot the road-side dialects that you hear on a map. Better yet,record some of the songs, make sonagrams, and plot those on a map.Maybe return the following year to determine if the songs or theirdistribution have changed.
