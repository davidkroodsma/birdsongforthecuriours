**The thrill of dawn-singing Brewer's sparrows.** For the thrill of alifetime (should be on every bird lover's bucket list), I encourageyou to experience for yourself a live performance of dawn-singingBrewer's sparrows. Arrive with plenty of warm clothing at least 90minutes before sunrise, set up a chair in the sagebrush, and getcomfortable. About half a dozen males will soon be within earshot, allsinging and calling continuously and simultaneously. In the dark, edgeout of your chair and sidle closer to one bird, and just try to followalong. Collect some numbers as to how much he calls, how much hesings, how long the songs are---whatever strikes your fancy. Or forgetthe numbers and just listen! Don't resist the urge to return onanother morning or two. To get an eyeful of what you might experience,import â™«505 into Raven Lite and watch the 24 minutes documented there.We know almost nothing about what these sparrows are doing during thedawn chorus. A simple description of how the dawn performance changesthrough the breeding season would be most enlightening.
