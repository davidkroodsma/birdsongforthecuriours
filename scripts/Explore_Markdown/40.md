**Getting to know song repertoires of individual birds.** For any species with a smallish repertoire, listen to an individual over an extended period and try to verify for yourself that the singer has only one or a few different songs. Here's a satisfying venture: One by one, get to know by ear all ten or so songs of a bird, like a song sparrow. Once you know all of his songs, you can follow along, hearing which song is on his mind through whatever and whenever circumstances arise. All kinds of questions then follow about how and when and where he uses his different songs, and you can begin to answer your questions.
