**Listening to female red-winged blackbirds.** Red-winged blackbirdsoffer excellent listening opportunities. Get comfortable beside alocal marsh where red-wings nest. Listen to the male sing, but thenlisten for the response from nearby females (two or more females mightrespond). Locate one female, perhaps foraging at water's edge, ormaybe where she is building a nest or even incubating her eggs. Thenlisten intently for exactly when she responds to his singing. Is shemore responsive after he has been quiet for a while? Is she mostresponsive during his first few songs, but then not so much afterthat, or when he changes the song he has been singing? (See "How aRepertoire Is Delivered," p. 94.) Does the probability of a responsevary with time of day? What numbers could you collect to betterunderstand the female's view of her world? Again, you are enteringlargely uncharted territory. Enjoy the exploring!
