**Exploring horned lark singing with Raven Lite.** In the daytime
singing of ♫482, would you believe that Raven Lite sonagrams show that
the first (at 0:06) and tenth (1:00) flourishes are identical, and that
the second (0:13) and eighteenth (2:01) are identical? In the dawn
singing of ♫483, the first (0:22) and third (0:34) flourishes are the
same, as are the second (0:34) and seventh (1:11). With some sleuthing
on Raven Lite, you could learn a lot more about how many flourishes he
has and how he delivers them during his two types of singing.
