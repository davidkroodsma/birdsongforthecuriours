**Song packages of yellow-throated vireos.** These vireos arefascinating singers. The bird above seemed to have two song packages,cut and dried, though more samples would have been needed to becertain of how he bundled his songs during extended performances. Ihave also heard a male repeat just one song more than a dozen times.What was that all about? Was that a "one-song package"? No two listensto these vireos are ever alike, and every singing bird deserves yourear. There is far more to explore among vireos, of course. Try yourears on the "solitary vireo" group---blue-headed (p. 169), Cassin's,and plumbeous vireos---for example. Listen to a Hutton's vireo, whorapidly repeats one simple song many times before switching toanother, and you will inevitably ask why it is so different from theother vireos. For more vireo fun, see p. 143 for the warbling vireo,p. 164 for the Bell's vireo, and p. 77 for the white-eyed vireo.
