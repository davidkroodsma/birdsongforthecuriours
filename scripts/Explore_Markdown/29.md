**Song matching by titmice.** Find a singing titmouse of any species. Clear your mind and just listen to what may be 500 repetitions of the same song. Eventually, if he continues to sing, he'll switch to another song. At some point, consciously listen for other males in the area. Chances are good that all males within earshot will be singing the very same song. Then who is first to switch to a new song? Who follows, and how quickly? In the East, the resident tufted titmouse is one of the first birds to sing in spring, giving an eager (human) listener a jump on spring listening.
