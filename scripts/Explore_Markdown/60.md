**Purple martin song flights.** For "human nightowls," for those who
enjoy the predawn hours, purple martins offer fascinating listening.
What a puzzle that cloud of singing males is, high overhead. At what
time, relative to sunrise, do these older males depart their martin
house and head skyward? Can I recognize the unique song of any
particular individual way up there, to monitor how he moves about? How
does the cloud of singers shift in space over time? And how does the
dawn singing change through the season? Is there really more dawn
singing when the older martins first arrive in spring, and far less
after most of the first-year males and females have straggled into the
breeding colony from their South American, nonbreeding home?
