**Indefatigable, bachelor males advertising for a mate.** For a weekor two during early spring, get to know a singing male by documentinghis singing effort to attract a mate to his territory. Males typicallyreturn from migration before females; each male establishes histerritory and then, until a female joins him, he is a bachelor andtypically sings all day long. Enjoy all-nighters? Find a localnightjar. Don't limit yourself to whip-poor-wills, but consider theirrelatives, such as a chuck-will's-widow or a common poorwill. Orchoose a songbird just returning from migration; warblers arefascinating, because many species use different songs in advertisingfor females and in fighting with males (e.g., yellow warbler, p. 115).If you don't want to choose a particular species, you could documentthe decline in singing for all species in an area by simply countingthe number of songs or singing birds that can be heard during aselected time period each morning (e.g., a 15-minute block of timeeach day beginning at 9 [a.m.]{.smallcaps}).

Among some species, each male attempts to attract several mates (amating system known as "polygyny"), and as a result his singing (or"displaying") can continue unabated throughout the nesting season. Heis, in effect, always seeking a mate to father more young. Below arethree examples, in addition to nine mentioned elsewhere in otherconÂ­texts in the book: ruffed grouse (p. 141), Anna's hummingbird (p.69), broad-tailed hummingbird (p. 22), American woodcock (p. 130),sedge wren (pp. 48, 91, 144, 159), marsh wren (pp. 34, 60), bobolink(p. 68), red-winged blackbird (pp. 18, 70, 117), and great-tailedgrackle (pp. 109, 166).
