**Call matching by male red-winged blackbirds.** Here's another marsh
experience. Settle in and get comfortable, focusing on the calls of one
particular male red-winged blackbird. How often does he change from one
call to the next? Hear how neighboring males often (how often?) match
each other with the same call from their local dialect. Perhaps *when*
they change calls might tell you something about *why* they change, or
why they have such a variety of calls in the first place. You might have
to walk around a bit to keep your bird in a calling mood. Does he change
calls in any way that is coordinated with your movements, or your
relative threat? Compare your local dialect with the three examples from
Illinois, Colorado, and Michigan. Similar? Different? Any unique calls
that you have never heard anywhere else?
