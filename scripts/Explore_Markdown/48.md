**Dawn-calling choruses in Swainson's thrushes and veeries.** What isit about these thrushes, and no other species I know, that leads themto call like this rather than sing? Does the intensity and duration ofcalling vary with the season, from the time they arrive frommigration, through pairing, nesting, and into late June and July? Howmany birds within a territory are calling? Initially just one bird,the male who has arrived first from migration, then two birds afterpairing? Or how about after the babies have fledged? Does the entirefamily awake in a calling bout? Do they also call like this uponawaking in South America during the nonbreeding season? Or inmigration? So many questions, so few answers.
