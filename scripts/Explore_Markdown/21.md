**Playing songs at slower speeds, lower frequencies.** Listening tobirdsong slowed four times, down to one-quarter speed, probably bringsus as close as we can come to appreciating the intricacies of birdsongas the birds themselves hear it. This book's website offers hundredsof sounds that you can download and import into the software programRaven Lite (see p. 178), where you can slow the songs to whateverspeed you wish as you watch the sonagrams dance across your computermonitor. I suggest beginning at one-quarter speed (0.25), and then gofrom there. Perhaps start with the thrushes, such as the Townsend'ssolitaire, eastern bluebird, varied thrush, veery, Swainson's thrush,wood thrush, and hermit thrush. You will soon realize all the more whythey are considered such special songsters. As you listen and watchthe sonagrams, can you find clear examples of two strikingly differentsounds being sung simultaneously, from the two voice boxes?
