**Duets by Carolina wrens and wrentits.** For the Carolina wren andthe wrentit, the female contribution to the vocal exchange is easilyheard, yet so little is known about when and under what circumstancesthe female adds her voice. What \"interesting numbers\" could youcollect to learn more about the interaction between mates? How doestime of day, time during the breeding season, behavior of neighboringpairs, and so on, affect the likelihood and energy with which thefemale participates in the vocal exchanges? The same questions couldbe asked of cardinals (below), but you also have to *watch* thecardinals intently, because the songs of the male and female are notreadily distinguishable by ear.
