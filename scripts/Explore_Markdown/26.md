**Neighboring male songbirds learn from each other.** This listeningadventure is best done with a species in which each male has only onesong, because instantly, in one song, a male tells you all he knowsfor the comparison you are about to make: the relative similarity inthe songs of neighboring males. Chipping sparrows, the two buntings,and yellowthroats are good for this project, simply because twoneighboring individuals with identical songs are so noticeable forthese species in which there is such great song variety *among* theindividuals in a population. Perhaps try listening to some of the manyother songbird species in which each male has a single song (see pagexx). Whenever you encounter a singing male of one of these species,listen carefully, memorizing the song pattern, and then listen for asong from the nearest neighbor. Very different? Similar? Identical!?As you listen, you tune your ears for what is important to the birds,and come a little closer to understanding how the world of birdsong isput together.

**Advanced exploration!** Here's a fine listening experience, thoughby ear alone you almost certainly will not be able to confirm what Itell you. In the mild climates of the West, from coastal Californiaand on up through western Washington, where the winters are mild andwhere many birds are resident year-round, take a birding stroll,listening to song sparrows, spotted towhees, and Bewick's wrens.Unlike the examples given above, the sparrows and towhees have about10 songs apiece, the wrens 16 to 20. Over a few hundred yards thesongs change, because distance leads to a degree of isolation: Openfields or unsuitable habitats intervene, so that the singing birds ateven short distances are to some degree isolated from each other. Whenyoung birds leave mom and dad and disperse, they settle on their ownbreeding territory some distance away, from a few hundred yards to amile or so. The young males then learn the songs at their own breedinglocation, forsaking whatever it was that they had learned from theirsinging father, thereby perpetuating the local micro-dialect wherethey settle. With considerable effort, you could document how thesesongs change over a distance, by recording males at various locationsand seeing the differences in sonagrams from those places. Mysuggestion if you choose to do this: Start with the spotted towhee,because males have fewer songs in their repertoire and each malequickly tells you all his songs during the dawn chorus (but you gottaget out early!).

That project was, in fact, the subject of my first publication as abudding professional ornithologist: Kroodsma, D. E. "Song Variationsand Singing Behavior in the Rufous-sided Towhee, *Pipiloerythrophthalmus oregonus*." *Condor* **73 (1971)**:303--308.
