**Improvised songs of red-eyed vireos.** This game is addictive, andear-sharpening: With each red-eyed vireo that you listen to---and theyare abundant wherever red-eyed vireos are found---search for (atleast) one odd, recognizable song. Patiently wait for him toeventually return to that song, maybe several times over a fewminutes. Then, once that unique song is committed to your auditorymemory, try to find that odd song in the repertoire of the next vireo.Listening closely like this takes a curious naturalist places onewould never before have imagined.
