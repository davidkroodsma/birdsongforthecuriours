**Seeing the magnificence of hermit thrush songs.** Even moresatisfying than listening to a hermit thrush is to both listen and seehis songs simultaneously. Import one of the hermit thrush recordingsinto Raven Lite. Then pick a unique, recognizable song and *see* howit resurfaces about ten songs later. If you print 20 to 30 sonagramsand sort them, you will come up with about ten distinctly differentpiles, indicating that each of the male's songs is well practiced andcommitted to memory. While in Raven Lite, play the songs at slowerspeeds, and backward, too.
