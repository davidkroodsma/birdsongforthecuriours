***Chick-a-dee* calls of North American chickadees.** Chickadees occur in one form or another throughout most of North America (besides the black-capped, the four others most frequently encountered are the Carolina, mountain, chestnut-backed, and boreal chickadees). They are common birds, especially at our winter feeders, and they all *chick-a-dee-dee-dee* in their own style (faster, slower, hoarser, etc.). Get to know chickadees better by counting the number of *dee* notes in their calls under a variety of circumstances. Then maybe try to manipulate the circumstance. Introduce a plastic owl near a feeder, for example, and listen to how the chickadees react. Or introduce a cat into the yard (but, heavens, only briefly!). Use your imagination as to what you think might be of concern to a chickadee, and then document how they adjust their *chick-a-dee* calls. You can practice your listening and counting with the *chick-a-dee* examples I provide on the website for the book.
