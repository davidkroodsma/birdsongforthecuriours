***Chick-a-dee* calls of North American chickadees.** Chickadees occurin one form or another throughout most of North America (besides theblack-capped, the four others most frequently encountered are theCarolina, mountain, chestnut-backed, and boreal chickadees). They arecommon birds, especially at our winter feeders, and they all*chick-a-dee-dee-dee* in their own style (faster, slower, hoarser,etc.). Get to know chickadees better by counting the number of *dee*notes in their calls under a variety of circumstances. Then maybe tryto manipulate the circumstance. Introduce a plastic owl near a feeder,for example, and listen to how the chickadees react. Or introduce acat into the yard (but, heavens, only briefly!). Use your imaginationas to what you think might be of concern to a chickadee, and thendocument how they adjust their *chick-a-dee* calls. You can practiceyour listening and counting with the *chick-a-dee* examples I provideon the website for the book.
