**A road trip through white-throated sparrow song dialects.** Take a
road trip, slowly, with the windows open, through white-throated sparrow
country, listening carefully to their songs. Start in the East and head
west, or reverse the direction. Stop and take a listening sample every
100 miles or so. How far have those western doublets encroached on the
eastern *oh sweet Canada* triplet songs? It's a dynamic situation,
exciting to track over time, to understand better the puzzling, rapid
cultural changes in birdsong that can occur over widespread geographic
areas.
