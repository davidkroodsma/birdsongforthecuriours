<p>The simple songs are reminiscent of the bouncing ball song of a field
sparrow, though neither so mellow nor so melancholy. Recording early
morning just 50 miles north of the Mexican border in Texas, I am warned
of certain dangers by a gentleman who stops by in a pickup truck.</p>

<p>♫702. In five segments, with fades out and in between the separate
recordings, I offer nearly 20 minutes in the singing life of this olive
sparrow. His songs aren't distinctive enough for me to keep track of
what he's up to, but I know, when hearing the difference in the first
two songs, that I'd enjoy learning more about him, and about his
neighbors. From 16:25 to 17:10, hear a pickup truck drive by, and then
back up, stopping at 18:20, the driver silently watching me from across
a high fence. Almost a minute later, I choose to break the silence with
a "'Morning." He responds in kind, friendly enough, eventually warning
me to "Watch out for wetbacks" before driving off, scaring my sparrow
off as well (but not me). April 7, 2013. Chaparral Wildlife Management
Area, Artesia Wells, Texas. (19:45)</p>
