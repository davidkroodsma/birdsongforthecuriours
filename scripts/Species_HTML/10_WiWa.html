<p>Before almost all other birds are stirring, while it's still pitch-black out, the willie sings from a bush beside the road. He is, in fact, known to sing through the night. <em>Sweet, pretty creature</em> he is said to sing. Listen carefully and you may hear him play with two different songs. When he sings a double song, are they always of the two different types? Does he favor one song over the other? In what pattern does he sing?</p>
