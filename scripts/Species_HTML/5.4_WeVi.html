<p>♫348. The imitations in ♫347 revealed. Listen (1) again to one of the
first ten songs above, then (2) to three imitated components extracted
from that song (imitations of great crested flycatcher, Carolina
chickadee, and wood thrush), and last (3) to an actual flycatcher,
chickadee, and thrush. The vireo's imitation of the flycatcher's upswept
<em>wheep</em> has a slightly different tonal quality, but is within the range
of what the vireo would hear from these flycatchers. (0:10)</p>
