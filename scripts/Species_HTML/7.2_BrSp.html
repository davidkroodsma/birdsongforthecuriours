<p>♫503. Singing at dawn is continuous, a canary-like song ramble sweeping
down the scale, alternated with long series of high, buzzy, insectlike
trills and <em>zeeet</em> calls. May 27, 2006. Pawnee National Grassland,
Colorado. (1:57)</p>

<p>♫505. Dawn singing, exhilarating and mesmerizing, as several males carry
on for minutes on end. Listen carefully in headphones and you hear the
sparrows flying about, with two or more singing near one another, much
as chipping sparrows do during the dawn chorus. May 29, 2009. Xylem
Acres, Ola, Idaho. (24:10)</p>
