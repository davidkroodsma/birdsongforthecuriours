<p>♫119. The contributions of left and right voice boxes isolated for five
flourishes. For each of five wood thrush songs, listen (in headphones)
first to a complete normal song. Then we listen to just the terminal
flourish of that song, at one-eighth normal speed, in three segments:
first, the lower voice from the left voice box (left ear in stereo
headphones); second, the upper voice from the right voice box (right
ear); third, the left and right voice together. May 10, 2007. Quabbin
Park, Ware, Massachusetts. (1:32)</p>
