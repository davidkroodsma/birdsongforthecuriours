<p>♫111. The two innate songs of the eastern phoebe, which have no
songbird-like song learning centers in their brains. In this selection,
the male alternates his two song forms, the <em>FEE-bee</em> with the buzzy
<em>bee</em> and the <em>FEE-b-bre-be</em> with the stuttered <em>b-bre-be.</em> June 2,
2008. Prairie State Park, Mindenmines, Missouri. (1:31)</p>
