<p>â™«41. Pied-billed grebes are noisy creatures with a considerable variety
of vocalizations; this vocalization could easily be considered a "song."
At least two birds vocalize here, as revealed by the overlap of their
sounds (beginning at 0:09 and again at 0:19), though I do not know if
the birds are male and female of a mated pair, or members of neighboring
pairs. June 11, 2009. Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Burns, Oregon.
