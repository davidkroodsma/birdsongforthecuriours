<p>Colonial honeyeaters, bell miners live in large, complex social groups. The miners feed mostly on the casings of psyllid bugs, which use eucalyptus sap to create their protective covering over themselves. A colony of miners defends its patch of the forest from almost all other small birds that might compete for their food source. As a result, this recording is relatively free of all other birdsounds.</p>
