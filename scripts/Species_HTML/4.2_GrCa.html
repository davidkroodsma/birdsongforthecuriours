<p>♫160. Song. Nearly two hours from the same catbird! I hoisted the
microphone up into the tree where he sang and let him have at it. It
would be some of the last birdsong to be heard during 2017, and I was
going to get my fill. (I hadn't anticipated an early arrival of the
garbage truck, lingering from 19:00 to 22:00.) This catbird has
improvised almost all that he sings, but on occasion one hears what
sounds like a blue jay . . . an eastern phoebe (clearly, at 2:52) . . .
a Carolina wren . . . was that a wood thrush? Longer pauses between
singing sessions are omitted and replaced with a three-second fade out
and fade back in. July 12, 2017. Hatfield, Massachusetts. (1:49:55).</p>
