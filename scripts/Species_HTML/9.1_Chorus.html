<p>â™«640. A chorus of singers at dawn. Standing among the low alders,
willows, and dogwoods along a stream in western Massachusetts, I stood
in awe, smiling, recording, the finest of sounds pouring from my
headphones into my ears. What a fine gathering of feathered singers in
this chorus: willow flycatcher (the focus initially), yellow warbler
(throughout, and in fine dawn form), orchard oriole, song sparrow,
American robin, common yellowthroat, red-winged blackbird, and in the
distance mourning dove and wood thrush. The individual efforts of all
these birds have appeared in solo performances elsewhere in the book.
