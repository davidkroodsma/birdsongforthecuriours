<p>The green catbird, another bowerbird, is no relative of the North American gray catbird, but they're both named for their cat-like meowing, though this green one sounds more like a crying child stuck high up in the tree. The male doesn't build a fancy bower, but instead clears a small stage and displays there, trying to attract females by using colorful flowers, fruits, or leaves in his bill. I wonder if this catbird has a limited number of stereotyped cat-like mewing "songs," like other songbirds have set repertoires, or if, like a crying child, no two cries are alike.</p>
