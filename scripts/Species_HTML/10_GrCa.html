<p>The green catbird, another bowerbird, is no relative of the NorthAmerican gray catbird, but they're both named for their cat-likemeowing, though this green one sounds more like a crying child stuckhigh up in the tree. The male doesn't build a fancy bower, but insteadclears a small stage and displays there, trying to attract females byusing colorful flowers, fruits, or leaves in his bill. I wonder ifthis catbird has a limited number of stereotyped cat-like mewing"songs," like other songbirds have set repertoires, or if, like acrying child, no two cries are alike.</p>
