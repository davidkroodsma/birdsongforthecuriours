<p>Illustrates well the "species problem." It was not a unanimous decision
in 2002 to recognize the black-crested titmouse of central Texas and
northern Mexico as a species different from the tufted titmouse. The
singing behavior of these two birds seems indistinguishable: Songs are
similar, both have smallish song repertoires and sing with "eventual
variety," and neighboring males match each other's songs.</p>

<p>â™«694. Sound like a tufted titmouse? I think so. Hear the matched
countersinging, with a bird in the background singing the same song as
the near bird? I hear (and see in Raven Lite) the distant bird at 0:04,
0:18, 0:29, 0:35, and more. At 1:40 the foreground titmouse does what
you'd expect a tufted to do, switch to a new song; listen closely, and
you'll hear the background bird also singing this new song (perhaps most
evident at 3:08 and 5:10). Enjoy also the black-and-white warbler
singing in a much higher register.</p>
