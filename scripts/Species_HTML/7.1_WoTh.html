<p>â™«458. Call notes of two wood thrushes going to roost, with soft <em>tut</em>s,
sharper <em>whit</em>s, and an occasional incomplete song as well, the
interaction between these two birds surging and fading until all is
quiet in the forest. May 21, 2010. Tye River Gap, Blue Ridge Parkway,
Virginia. (4:52)</p>
