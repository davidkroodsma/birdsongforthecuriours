<p>♫405. Over 200 songs, delivered in typical rock wren fashion. Sometimes
he was at the top of the boulder looking down on me, and when he slipped
behind the boulder, his songs were not as loud. During his dozen songs
in the first minute, he uses five different songs in the following
sequence: A B A C B C B D C B D E. June 12, 2008. Jeffrey City, Wyoming.
