<p>â™«457. The wild cackling, untamed and primeval, often given just
before going to the roosting tree. Initially the female is perched about
100 yards away, across the frozen water of the swamp, and then at 0:25
begins her approach, landing about 10 yards away from her nest cavity.
With all clear for the finale, at 0:40 she flies the last 10 yards and
settles into her roosting cavity for the night. January 1, 2004.
Norwottuck Rail Trail, Amherst, Massachusetts. (0:50)</p>
