<p>â™«159. Songs from two individuals. We focus first on a nearby male,
listening to him repeat one of his improvised songs 16 times (until
1:08). He then sings one song of a different type (oh so similar to the
first!&mdash;listen carefully and you may hear the switch) before we swing
the microphone over to a more distant bird, so that the unique,
back-to-back songs of the two birds can be more easily heard. Last, at
2:15 we swing back to the first bird, hearing him switch to another of
his 100 or so different songs. May 28, 2016. Sax-Zim Bog, Minnesota.
