<p>♫439. Typical singing. Each song consists of soft, introductory <em>bup
bup</em> notes, followed by a prelude of fast-paced, pure tones, and then a
somewhat percussive terminal trill (the flourish). May 10, 2007. Quabbin
Park, Ware, Massachusetts. (3:19)</p>

<p>♫443. Successive songs always have different preludes and flourishes,
and the magic in the wood thrush's singing is lost when a particular
prelude-flourish combination is repeated several (here 10) times in
succession. Here are three different songs, each repeated 10 times, for
a total of 30 songs. No wood thrush would ever sing like this, of
course; I concocted this recording by rearranging and repeating songs in
my editing software. (1:48)</p>

<p>♫444. The thrush's magic is also lost when the same prelude but
different flourishes occur in two or three successive songs. Here,
listen for the repeating preludes with two to three different
flourishes; these songs are naturally occurring combinations in this
wood thrush's performance, but he never offers them back-to-back like
this (again, this recording is my concoction). (0:35)</p>
