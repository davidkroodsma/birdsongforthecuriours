<p>♫138. Half an hour before sunrise, this mourning dove offers his
contribution to a rather quiet early spring dawn chorus. In the
background are other mourning doves and two countersinging black-capped
chickadees exchanging their <em>hey-sweetie</em> on different pitches (see also
p. 155 in the book). 5:55 to 6:02 a.m.; sunrise at 6:28
a.m. April 30, 2018. Atlanta, Michigan. (7:11)</p>
