<p>This golden-crowned bird is in the genus <em>Zonotrichia</em>, making it a
close relative of the white-crowned and white-throated sparrows. Like
the white-throats and white-crowns, each male golden-crown is believed
to have just one song. To quote the Birds of North America website,
there's "No evidence that males sing >1 song type each," but the BNA
also says ". . . little is known about patterns of individual or spatial
variation in Golden-crowned Sparrow song." There's an opening for the
curious naturalist who loves the far north! For starters, listen to this
one male from Alaska. Doesn't it sound as if he has two different songs?
Is he atypical? Wish we had recordings of his neighbors . . .</p>

<p>♫697. <em>Ohhhhh, deeaaar mee</em>, he seems to sing, but he seems to have two
different songs. The first occurs seven times until 1:15, but then a
second, longer variant occurs at 1:25. You can hear a local
white-crowned sparrow in the background (best heard beginning about
1:10). Enjoy this bit of Alaska. June 15, 2015. Mile post 34, Denali
Highway, Alaska. (2:43)</p>
