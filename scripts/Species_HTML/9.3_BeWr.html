<p>♫685. Beginning in 1969, a good half-century ago, I began my journey
with birdsong with this species, the Bewick's wren, as I studied them
for my graduate research. I now know of no finer listening experience
than to stand and listen to a Bewick's wren motor through the dawn
chorus, as this male does for nearly 35 minutes. Listen for the second
Bewick's wren in the background. For a full minute, from 12:16 to 13:26,
he calls, but doesn't sing. March 26, 2017. Joshua Tree National Park,
California. (34:38). Recorded by Janet Grenzke.</p>

<p>♫686. And once is not enough, as we returned to listen to this male a
second morning. If we hadn't had a plane to catch, we'd have been back
for more mornings. March 27, 2017. Joshua Tree National Park,
California. (38:23). Recorded by Janet Grenzke.</p>
