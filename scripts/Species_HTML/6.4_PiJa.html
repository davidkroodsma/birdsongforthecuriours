<p>♫452. California scrub-jay: An example of jay "song," similar to the
rambling plastic song of young songbirds in non-corvid families (see p.
49 in the book). At 1:40, hear the "rattle call," thought to be given
only by the female scrub-jay. In this kind of rambling subsong, however,
with the bird perhaps experimenting with all its known sounds, it could
also be a male. This bird was well-hidden in the bushes, and then seemed
to vocalize only when the loudest wind gusts or passing vehicle would
best conceal the vocal effort, as if the bird had no desire to be heard.
Although the recording could have been edited to remove some of the wind
and vehicle noise, that would have destroyed the true conditions under
which the jay had its say. September 3, 2018. Eugene, Oregon. (1:50)
Recorded by Mieko Aoki.</p>
