<p>♫38. Nestling red-shouldered hawks. The younger birds in the nest
already have a hint of the adult <em>kee-aah</em> in their voices (e.g.,
0:30-0:43, and 1:03-1:17), and the oldest sibling perched outside the
nest is very convincing (e.g., at 0:54 and 1:21). June 21, 2014.
Belchertown, Massachusetts. (3:41)</p>
