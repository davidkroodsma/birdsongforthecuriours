<p>Flocks of grackles and accompanying "black birds" (red-winged
blackbirds, European starlings) are a sure sign of spring arriving in
New England. When listening to a breeding colony of grackles, it helps
to know that both males and females sing, and that each bird has a
unique song identifying it as an individual. The female sings most often
early in the spring, usually when "answering" her mate, with the two
songs coming in rapid succession. Listen first here to the early spring
flock of black birds, then to the distinctive songs of individual
grackles, and last to the larger grackle colony, trying to pick out
individuals by their voices.</p>

<p>♫691. A magnificent early spring flock of black birds: grackles,
red-winged blackbirds, and no doubt starlings. April 15, 2012. Hatfield,
Massachusetts. (9:17)</p>

<p>♫692. Sensitize your grackle-listening ears first here, where I have
excerpted from a longer recording three song renditions from each of three singers. March
18, 2012. Hatfield, Massachusetts. (0:12)</p>

<p>♫693. Here's the longer recording from which those few songs of the
breeding colony in ♫692 were extracted. Perhaps you can find more examples of
songs from those three males, or listen for other individuals, but for
the most part just enjoy the great variety of songs among the birds in
this flock. March 18, 2012. Hatfield, Massachusetts. (10:18)</p>
