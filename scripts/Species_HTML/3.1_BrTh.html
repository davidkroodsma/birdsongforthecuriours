<p>â™«84. Singing by an unpaired male, only a brief sample from a multi-day
session that continued until he attracted his mate. Several imitations
of other species can be heard: Carolina chickadee song, 0:44 and 2:42;
female red-winged blackbird call, 2:01; Carolina wren song, 2:22;
northern flicker song, 2:25; northern cardinal, single slurred song
whistle, 2:32 (using his two voice boxes to produce the two-voiced
cardinal sound, just as the cardinal does---see p. 40 in the book). May 6, 2006.
