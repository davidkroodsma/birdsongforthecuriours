<p>Bowerbirds! What extraordinary creatures, as the males build bowers inthe form of huts, avenues, maypoles, or simply cleared spaces on theforest floor as part of their sexual display to females. In themountainous forests of northeast Queensland, the tooth-bill createshis display court in a cleared stage, with at least one tree trunk forperching, decorating the stage with fresh green leaves that are laidmostly so that the pale sides face up. And he sings, throughout muchof the day, as he is always seeking a mate (see p. xx). Here arenearly five continuous hours from one male, made from about 7[a.m]{.smallcaps}. to noon.</p>

<p>I love scrolling through his singing performance in Raven Lite---I seevarious themes that he sings for a while before actually switching toanother. I wonder how many themes he has? Could I find out in onlyfive hours of listening? And how many times does he repeat a themebefore switching? I bet he goes bonkers with his themes when a femalearrives---unfortunately, I had no such luck during my five-hour vigil.October 20, 2007. Lake Eachem, Queensland. (4:47:28)</p>

<p>♫714, hour 1. One pause of 5:30 duration. Hear him switch to a newtheme at the two minute mark? A little after seven minutes, anAustralian brush turkey walks by, calling. (1:00:00)</p>
