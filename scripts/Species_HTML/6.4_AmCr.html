<blockquote>
  <p>0:00-0:19. Three chipping sparrow songs in foreground as a crow approaches from a distance.</p>
  
  <p>0:10-1:07. Slow, sharp, <em>ca-ca-ca-ca</em> from first crow to land in the nearby tree.</p>
  
  <p>1:11. Frantic calling begins, at double the <em>ca-ca-ca</em> pace, then slows again.</p>
  
  <p>2:40. A second crow has arrived, and they call simultaneously. Listen again, and again, to that two-second burst of crowness. The first crow gives two sharp <em>ca</em> notes, the same <em>ca</em> notes he was giving before the second bird arrived, but then he switches to the hoarse <em>caw</em> that the second bird gave upon arriving. The two now match each other. I love these crows!</p>
  
  <p>3:17. Simultaneous calling again, both using the hoarse <em>caw</em>.</p>
  
  <p>4:45. More simultaneous calling, and matching, with a slightly different <em>caw</em> version.</p>
  
  <p>5:15. One bird begins with longer <em>caw</em> notes than the other, but midway the two birds match each other with the shorter caw again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there's so much more to hear, the above being just a few examples of
how these crows interact. Throughout, and in headphones, listen for
slightly different versions of the hoarse <em>caw</em> notes, and how the two
birds often match each other's versions.</p>
