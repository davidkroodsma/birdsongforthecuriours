0:00-0:19. Three chipping sparrow songs in foreground as a crowapproaches from a distance.</p>

<p>0:10-1:07. Slow, sharp, <em>ca-ca-ca-ca</em> from first crow to land in thenearby tree.</p>

<p>1:11. Frantic calling begins, at double the <em>ca-ca-ca</em> pace, thenslows again.</p>

<p>2:40. A second crow has arrived, and they call simultaneously. Listenagain, and again, to that two-second burst of crowness. The first crowgives two sharp <em>ca</em> notes, the same <em>ca</em> notes he was giving beforethe second bird arrived, but then he switches to the hoarse <em>caw</em> thatthe second bird gave upon arriving. The two now match each other. Ilove these crows!</p>

<p>3:17. Simultaneous calling again, both using the hoarse <em>caw</em>.</p>

<p>4:45. More simultaneous calling, and matching, with a slightlydifferent <em>caw</em> version.</p>

<p>5:15. One bird begins with longer <em>caw</em> notes than the other, butmidway the two birds match each other with the shorter caw again.</p>

<p>And there's so much more to hear, the above being just a few examples of
how these crows interact. Throughout, and in headphones, listen for
slightly different versions of the hoarse <em>caw</em> notes, and how the two
birds often match each other's versions.</p>
