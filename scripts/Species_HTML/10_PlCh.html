<p>The plain chachalaca is a largely arboreal bird, related to grouse and
chickens in the order Galliformes. In North America, it is a south Texas
specialty, but this particular recording comes from Tikal National Park
in Guatemala. This bird is named for its sounds, a loud, raucous,
ear-shattering <em>cha-cha-lac</em> heard especially from awaking birds during
early morning hours. A paired male and female duet, and the extended
chorus from several pairs at dawn is exhilarating.</p>

<p>â™«710. In this awaking chorus, the nearby male
starts it off with his loud, low <em>cha-cha-lac</em>, the female immediately
responding with her higher-pitched version. He's off to the left, she to
the right in this stereo recording. Other pairs in the background sound
off as well.</p>
