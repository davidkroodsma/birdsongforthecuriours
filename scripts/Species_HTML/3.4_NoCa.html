<p>♫124. One example of each of those four song types, slowed to quarter
speed (A B C D). To hear the two voice boxes, listen carefully to the
first ten seconds, which contains three slurred whistles. The first
whistle has an abrupt break separating the two voices, but in the next
two the transition between the two voices is more subtle, but still
audible. (1:21)</p>
