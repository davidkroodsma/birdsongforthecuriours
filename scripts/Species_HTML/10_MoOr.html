<p>Oropendolas are blackbirds in the family Icteridae, distant relatives of
our North American blackbirds and grackles, though by their songs you'd
never know it. For half a second or so, the male Montezuma oropendola
whines ever so softly on a single rising note, then for about two
seconds bubbles and gurgles along, rising in pitch and intensity, to the
terminal climax of a rapidly modulated quarter second note (♫711). Slow
the songs down and study the sonagrams, and you can then hear and see
that he is using his two voice boxes (♫712). Below 1 kHz, almost
certainly with his left voice box, he bounces among alternating higher
and lower notes, while up above with his right voice box he accompanies
in a higher register. The overall effect when heard at quarter speed is
extraordinary, and now the ending climatic note sounds like a trumpeting
elephant.</p>

<p>But there's more! He also "sings" a most unbirdlike sound, as if he were
thrashing tree branches, breaking them to smithereens. What the&mdash;? How
does he do that? Slow that song to quarter speed and it truly sounds
like an elephant crashing through the forest, throwing large tree trunks
aside with abandon. What a striking contrast between these two "songs"
of the Montezuma oropendola! February 16, 2011. Mundo Perdido ("Lost

<p>♫711. Standing beside one of the pyramids in the Lost World at Tikal
National Park, I gaze up in wonder, the songs of this blackbird booming
into my ears (amplified into my headphones, of course). In this
selection, he sings the pure-toned song repeatedly, but every once in a
while offers the branch-thrashing song (e.g., 3:56, 4:10). After 16
minutes, I need to get closer to him, so I climb the pyramid, recording
just a few more sounds from up there, at eye level with him, before he
flies off. (19:47)</p>

<p>♫712. At quarter speed, the four songs from 17:07 to 17:28 in the above
recording. Slowed down, you hear first the elephant crashing through the
forest, then the two voices in the pure-toned song bouncing along to the
terminal elephant bugle. (0:52)</p>
