<p>♫482. More daytime singing, same Sierra Valley 17 years later, still
with cattle, and a touch of western meadowlark (initial note and later
songs). Thirty stuttered flourishes over three and a half minutes. June
12, 2018. Sierra Valley, California. (3:31)</p>

<p>♫483. What a special singing performance these horned larks provide well
before sunrise. The flourishes now occur only after long strings of
lower notes, with up to five flourishes per minute (e.g., in the first
minute they occur at 0:22, 0:30, 0:34, 0:37, 0:51; in the second minute
at 1:03, 1:11, 1:20, 1:28, 1:47, though that last one sounds
incomplete). This male sings from a gravel road, with me standing to the
side; every once in a while he relocates (at 5:23, 8:45), especially
when a car passes (at 17:50), and it takes me a little while to relocate
him with the parabolic microphone. 4:40 to 5:03 a.m. Sunrise at 5:33 a.m. June 14, 2018. Sierra
Valley, California. (22:41)</p>

<p>♫484. Another horned lark in the dark, again all air-time filled with
four to five notes each second, punctuated with an occasional flourish.
A lark bunting sings first, and at about 0:10 the song of the horned
lark emerges to take center stage. 4:39 to 4:45 a.m. Sunrise at 5:31 a.m. May 27, 2006. Murphy's
Pasture, Pawnee National Grassland, Colorado. (6:00)</p>
