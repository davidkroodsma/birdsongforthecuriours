<p>Not chinchilla, but chowchilla, with one of the finest sounds of the wet, tropical rainforests of Australia. It is said that they sing <em>chow</em> and <em>chilla</em>, but I don't hear it, perhaps because chowchillas have song dialects that vary from place to place.</p>

<p>♫723. A pair. Listen and you hear what sounds like one male singing loudly with a second bird chattering in the background. October 21,2007. Lake Eachem, Queensland. (3:43)</p>

<p>♫724. A group. Unbeknownst to me, a friend just down the road had played chowchilla songs to these birds that then came my way. Wow, all members of the flock now seem to be fully engaged in proclaiming who they are and what real estate they own! October 22, 2007. Near the Cathedral Fig Tree, Atherton Tablelands, Queensland. (8:34)</p>
