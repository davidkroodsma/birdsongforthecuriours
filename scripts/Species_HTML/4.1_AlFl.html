<p>♫147. Willow flycatcher: Songs? Yes, indeed, the entire dawn chorus from
one individual. What a marvelous recording to explore in all its glory.
He stirs on his night roost with a couple of soft calls (beginning at
0:04) and soon takes flight, singing on the wing; distant songs in the
flight are heard from 1:13 to 1:20. Listen with headphones and you'll
hear him circle around in this stereo recording. He then settles back on
his perch, and his first true "song" is heard there at 1:49, a <em>creet</em>,
then a <em>FIZZ-bew,</em> and he's off and running for the next 51 minutes.
