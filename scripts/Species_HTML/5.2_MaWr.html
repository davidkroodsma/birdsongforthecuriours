<p>♫230. Over several days, to illustrate how neighboring males often match
each other during countersinging, I worked to record simultaneously two
neighboring males in a drainage ditch beside the road. Alas, although
the two males seem to take turns singing, indicating that they are
listening to each other, I can hear very little, if any, song matching
in these exchanges. How disappointing, yet how illuminating. When and
why marsh wrens choose to play the matched countersinging game remains a
mystery! June 10, 2018. Sierra Valley, California. (10:57)</p>

<p>♫231. Nearly an hour of singing from one male. I did my best to hold the
parabolic reflector on him, but he at times escaped my aim for a few
seconds. Enjoy the "raw" field recording&mdash;this is the best that I could
do with this male as he flew up and down the drainage ditch beside the
road. Enjoy a good, easy listen, but there's so much you could do to
search for patterns in this male's behavior. June 10, 2018. Sierra
Valley, California. (58:10)</p>

<p>♫232. Here's evidence that the male in the previous recording is capable
of repeating himself, that is, he has a set repertoire of discrete song
types that he can recall from memory and sing again. Four examples of
one song type are extracted from the nearly hour-long recording (the
four renditions of this particular song were found at 2:06, 9:18, 30:30,
and 42:51; the song at 13:18 is slightly different). June 10, 2018.

<p>♫233. Not only does a male eventually repeat one of his songs, but the
sequences in which he delivers his different songs are often the same as
well. Here, I've taken the four examples from ♫232 and included the next
two songs as well; careful listening (and sonagram study) reveals that
he sings A B C . . . A B C . . . A B D . . . A B D. Song A is always
followed by song B, which is followed by either C or D. June 10, 2018.
