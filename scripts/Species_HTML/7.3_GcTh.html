<p>â™«533. Beginning about 12:30 [a.m.]{.smallcaps}, about half an hour after
sunset, this gray-cheeked thrush sang through the short night and well
past sunrise (about 3:30 [a.m.]{.smallcaps}). Stay with him through his
three-minute respites from 24:20 to 27:20 and 50:30 to 53:50, for a
little over an hour total. June 15, 2017. Denali Highway, Alaska.
