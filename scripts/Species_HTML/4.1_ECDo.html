<p>♫139. <em>Koo-KOO-kook</em> song, with mechanical wing sounds as the bird flies
off. At 3:19 three typical "landing calls" (<em>hwaah</em>  <em>hwaah</em>  <em>hwaah</em>)
are heard as the bird alights perhaps 50 yards away on the utility
wires. An oak titmouse sings in the background. March 20, 2017. Los
Osos, California. (3:24)</p>
