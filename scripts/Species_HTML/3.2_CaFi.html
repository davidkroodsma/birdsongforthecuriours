<p>♫95. Song of a male apparently courting a female, muted, punctuated with
high, intense notes. Listen for the mimicry of the northern flicker
(0:04, 0:12) and ruby-crowned kinglet (0:02, 0:12). If you check this
song out in Raven Lite, look carefully at 0:04.8 (almost five seconds
into the recording), where two different sounds used simultaneously
reveal that he's using his two voice boxes here. June 2, 2009. Old
Faithful, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. (0:18)</p>
