<p>♫670. Two loons at 50 yards, on a small pond in northern Michigan! I'm
unprepared, caught unawares, but run for the recording gear, hoping
they'll continue. Minutes later, the two are still at it, apparently one
chasing the other, splashing about on the surface, diving together and
resurfacing a good distance away, still together. They call all the
while, with the "tremolo." Given their behavior, and given that the
tremolo is used in agonistic interactions with other loons, this is
likely some kind of dispute between two adults. August 17, 2014.
Atlanta, Michigan. (9:23)</p>

<p>♫671. The wail. An hour past midnight on a small lake in the remote
Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, a nearby loon repeatedly
"wails," with other loons in the distant background. With pickerel
frogs. May 25, 2002. Mason Lake, Hamilton, New York. (2:41) Recorded by
Gregory Budney</p>

<p>♫672. Putting it all together! Listen to the soft "hoot" of a nearby
bird at 0:05, followed by wails (e.g., 0:10, 0:20) and male yodels
(e.g., nearby at 0:16, 0:30). Early May, 2011. Lake Opeongo in Algonquin
Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. (1:39) Generously shared by Lang
Elliott and excerpted from <em>Loon Lake</em>, by Lang Elliott and Bob McGuire.
From https://store.musicofnature.com/products/loon-lake/: "LOON LAKE
features over an hour of continuous, awe-inspiring magic recorded in
Algonquin National Park, Ontario, in early May, shortly after ice-out.
Listen as loons call from near and far, their wails, yodels, and
tremolos echoing across still waters against a backdrop of distant
spring peepers. At once relaxing, beautiful and sublime, this recording
evokes pure pleasure, and is certain to please." For more offerings from
