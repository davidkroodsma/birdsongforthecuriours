<p>♫328. At dawn, he begins slowly with calls and a few songs, but soon he
calls far more than he sings, and successive songs are always different.
Gradually he moderates his effort, offering fewer calls between songs
and repeating a given song type several times before switching to
another (details in book's text). 5:44 to 6:41 a.m. Sunrise at 6:22 a.m. May 4, 2017. Atlanta,
Michigan. (57:07)</p>
