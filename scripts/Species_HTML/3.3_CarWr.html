<p>♫109. Eight male songs, just one example of each, excerpted from a
longer sequence in which each of the songs was repeated many times;
these eight songs represent perhaps a quarter of the songs he knows. A
commonly used mnemonic for the song is <em>tea-kettle tea-kettle
tea-kettle</em>, or <em>lib-er-ty, lib-er-ty, lib-er-ty</em>. October 16, 2003.

<p>♫110. If the female Carolina wren were to learn her song and duet with
her mate, as do many of this wren's tropical relatives, the typical
<em>tea-kettle</em> song might be bisected, with one bird singing perhaps the
<em>tea</em>, the other the <em>kettle</em>, as I've simulated in this selection.
