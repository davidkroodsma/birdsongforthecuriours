<p>Our all-American robin has about 80 close relatives in the same genus
<em>Turdus</em> throughout the world. You can find them in North and South
America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia&mdash;everywhere but
Antarctica!</p>

<p>One of these close relatives is the "blackbird" mentioned in the English
nursery rhyme "Four and twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie." That's the
same blackbird Cat Stevens sang about: "Morning has broken . . .
Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird . . ." That would be the
Eurasian blackbird, <em>Turdus merula</em>, who behaves and sings much like our
North American robin, <em>Turdus migratorius</em>. Both are, for example, among
the first birds to sing in the morning. (Note: The Eurasian blackbird is
not in the American blackbird family Icteridae, nor is the "European
robin" in the genus <em>Turdus</em>&mdash;common names can certainly be confusing.)</p>

<p>Listen (♫687).What similarities do you hear in the singing of the
American robin and the Eurasian blackbird? What differences? This
blackbird was recorded first thing in the morning, when the roosters
were still crowing, so it's best to compare it to a dawn singing
American robin with both carols and <em>hisselly</em> notes, such as ♫14, ♫15,
or ♫16. Listen to other robins (genus <em>Turdus</em>) as you travel,
considering how these robins have moved through evolutionary time and
space throughout this <em>Turdus</em> lineage. April 1, 2014. Majorca, Spain.
